      <h2>Crime Reporting</h2> 
      <p>The campus community is strongly encouraged to report all known or suspected incidents of criminal activity on campus to the University Police Department as soon as possible. When calling the University Police Department always:</p>

       <br>The campus Emergency Alert Hotline (866) 869-POLY (7659) is a recorded message with information related to immediate emergencies that may be happening on campus. The message may contain information related to building closures, employee/work status information, and campus closures. The campus community is encouraged to add this number to their contact lists. 
       <br>
       <br> 
       <h2>Special Safeguards for Facilities or Activities</h2> 
       <h3>Security of and Access to Campus Facilities</h3> 
       <p>All campus facilities are key or card accessed, and most are open daily for scheduled campus community use. Housing facilities security includes both key entry and card access. Access to on-campus student housing facilities is restricted to residents, their approved/escorted guests and other approved campus community members. Campus key control and distribution is a function of Facilities Management. The Division of Information Technology manages alarm and card access control. To provide for the security of campus facilities, the University Police Department enforces Educational Code 89031 and Housing Policies. Campus facility access may be revoked per Penal Code 626. Non-monitored, recording security cameras are located in various buildings throughout campus. Some campus security cameras may be monitored by the University Police Department or accessed for real-time use.</p> 
       <p>Access to Campus Facilities is currently limited due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Cal Poly Pomona campus remains open. The 2020-21 academic year is predominantly on-line and campus offices and services may have modified operations. University critical services continue, including campus law enforcement and security functions.</p> 
       <p>To mitigate the risk and spread of COVID-19, only faculty, staff, and students with approved in-person instruction or other activities should come to campus. Virtual training and a daily health screener are required. Information for our community may be found on-line at <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/safety/safer-return/index.shtml">https://www.cpp.edu/safety/safer-return/index.shtml</a>, including checklist items required for students, staff and faculty.</p> 
       <h2>Security Considerations Used in Maintenance of Campus Facilities</h2> 
       <p>Campus facilities and grounds are designed and maintained to promote safety and prevent crime and are inspected on a regular basis. Grounds staff keep vegetation controlled around lighting and along campus walkways and roadways on a regular schedule. Concepts of crime prevention through environmental design are considered for new construction, planning and improvements on campus.</p> 
      </div> 
      <div> 
       <h2>Special Event Safety Planning</h2> 
       <p>Preparation for large campus events involves the creation of Incident Action Plans according to the Standardized Emergency Management system and in collaboration with mutual aid agencies and contracted safety personnel. <br><br>Consistent with California Department of Public Health recommendations, the campus is promoting social distancing by canceling all events and gatherings on or off campus through February 1, 2021. No public gatherings of any size affiliated with the university are permitted either on or off campus. This includes all clubs and organizations. We will continue to update this as recommendations evolve. You may find events information on-line at: <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/safety/safer-return/key-areas-of-effort/events.shtml">https://www.cpp.edu/safety/safer-return/key-areas-of-effort/events.shtml</a></p> 
       <h2>New Student Orientations</h2> 
       <p>University Police personnel provide personal safety tips and emergency contact information to new students on a regular basis. Students are informed of policies, voluntary confidential crime reporting procedures, and safety programs through regular outreach through email, social media, and tabling at events throughout the academic year.</p> 
       <h2>New Employee Orientations</h2> 
       <p>Human Resource Services presents safety policies and procedures to new employees by in-person and/or virtual orientations. Employees are informed of injury and illness prevention, workplace violence prevention, confidential victim/survivor counseling services, safety programs, and voluntary confidential crime reporting procedures.</p> 
       <h2>Actions in the Last 18 Months to Increase Safety</h2> 
       <p>• Activated EOC and established Safer Return Task Force.<br>• Implemented State and County health orders, recommended protocols and safety measures, and campus Safer Return strategies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.<br>• Implemented University Housing COVID-19 safety measures, including resident Bronco Care Pledge, a no guest/visitor policy, and identifying isolation facilities.<br>• Completed annual update of the Emergency Operations Plan.<br>• Created Police Advisory Task Force (PATF) to provide guidance and recommendations related to community policing and the composition of a police advisory board.<br>• Implemented body worn cameras for sworn police officers to increase transparency and accountability.<br>• Updated all police policies and published for public access to meet current mandated standards.<br>• Updated police Use of Force policy and removed carotid holds as an option.<br>• Conducted de-escalation, hate crime and Stop the Bleed training for all police officers.<br>• Conducted a comprehensive assessment of campus alarm/access system and blue light phones.<br>• Developed Faculty/Staff Crisis Response manual spearheaded by the Student Affairs Division.<br>• Implemented the nationally recognized R.A.D.

       <h2>Changes in Safety Precautions During the Next 24 Months</h2>

       <h2>California State University, Pomona Statistical Report 2019</h2>
