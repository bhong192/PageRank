Information on currently available ways to meet this graduation requirement may be obtain from The Office of Academic Programs.</p> <p><strong>Undergraduates</strong></p> <p>All undergraduates subject to degree requirements listed in the 1977-78 and later general catalogs must demonstrate competency in writing skills as a requirement for graduation. Based on action taken by the Cal Poly Pomona Academic Senate in 1978, writing competence at Cal Poly Pomona is assessed primarily by means of a written test. All persons who receive undergraduate, or external degrees from Cal Poly Pomona must pass the Graduation Writing Test (GWT). The test is available to undergraduates at the completion of 60 units.</p> <p>The test must be taken by the term following the completion of 75 units for undergraduates.&nbsp; If the GWT is not taken by this time, a hold will be placed on a student's records.

A minor shall have a minimum of 18 units and a maximum of 36 units, of at least 9 units must be upper division. Some minors may be greater than 36 units if prerequisites are included. Minor may be declared at any time in a student's career, are tracked in BroncoDirect (PeopleSoft), and appear on diplomas and transcripts. Students may declare a minor in the same department as their major or option if the college or department determines that that two sets of courses are clearly distinct.</p> <h3>Emphases</h3> <p>Emphases are a collection of courses advisory in nature. Emphases are not formally declared, are not tracked in BroncoDirect (PeopleSoft) and do not appear on transcripts or diplomas.</p> <h1><a name="Minimum_Grade_Point_Average"></a>Minimum Grade Point Average</h1> <p>In order to graduate, a student must have an overall Grade Point Average GPA of 2.0 in all university coursework, in Cal Poly Pomona coursework, and in major coursework (e.g. required and designated subplan courses). If an undergraduate student, at the time of the graduation check, has less than a 2.0 GPA, the student may attempt to raise the GPA to a minimum of 2.0 by the following courses of action:</p> 
                  <ol start="1" style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">

Further, this university has the right to prescribe that any particular graduation requirement be met within seven (7) years. For further details on this prescription please see the Registrar's Office, Building 121.</p> <h1><a id="minimum_grades_in_ge" name="minimum_grades_in_ge"></a>Minimum Grades in General Education</h1> <p>Effective for new and returning students admitted fall 2015 or later, a grade of C- or better is required of each Cal Poly Pomona or transfer student completing courses in written communication in the English language (GE Sub-area A2), oral communication in the English language (GE Sub-area A1), critical thinking (GE Sub-area A3), and mathematics/quantitative reasoning (GE Sub-area B4).</p> <h1><a name="Determination_of_Graduation_Requirements"></a>Determination of Graduation Requirements (Election of Regulations)</h1> <p>In determining graduation requirements, students have three basic options open to them. They may decide to meet the degree requirements listed in the Cal Poly Pomona university catalog for any of these three situations:</p> <p>1. They may use the requirements in effect at the time they first entered the university&nbsp;</p> <p>2. They may decide to use the requirements listed in the university catalog at the time of their graduation</p> <p>3. They may elect to use the requirements in effect at the time they began study at a CSU campus or a California community college (if the student had continuous enrollment).</p> <p>At Cal Poly Pomona, all colleges/schools evaluate incoming students on the current curriculum for their major requirements. Questions on this matter should be directed to the student's advisor or department chair.</p> <p>Whenever a student changes major, while this action is not considered a break in enrollment status, they may elect to use either the major department degree graduation requirements published in the Cal Poly Pomona university catalog at the time the major was changed or the requirements in the catalog at the time of graduation.</p> <p>California community college students transferring to Cal Poly Pomona without a break in enrollment status will be evaluated on the graduation requirements listed in the Cal Poly Pomona university catalog at the time of entrance to Cal Poly Pomona. Students may elect via petition to fulfill graduation requirements at the time they began attending a California community college or in effect at the time of graduation. After entry to Cal Poly Pomona, any change of status or major will cause them to come under the major degree catalog provisions valid at the time of the change.</p> <p>Students who are not in attendance for more than one term in any given calendar year are considered to have broken enrollment status and will be discontinued from the University. This will affect both major and other degree requirements and may require additional course work for degree completion and/or require the student to apply for readmission.</p> <p>If a student wishes to complete requirements at another institution, that work must be completed within one (1) semester or two (2) quarters of last enrollment at Cal Poly Pomona in order to maintain continuous enrollment status.</p> <p>For purposes of this section "attendance" means attendance in at least one semester or two quarters each calendar year (January 1 through December 31). Absence due to an approved educational leave or for attendance at another accredited institution of higher learning shall not be considered an interruption in attendance, if the absence does not exceed two calendar years.</p> <p>Cal Poly Pomona may prescribe that particular academic requirements be met within as few as seven (7) years of the date of award of the degree.</p> <p>For additional information on compliance see the Registrar's Office, Building 121.</p> <h1><a id="participation_in_graduation_ceremonies" name="participation_in_graduation_ceremonies"></a>Participation in Commencement Ceremonies</h1> <p>Undergraduate students may apply for early participation in commencement if they have no more than six units remaining to fulfill the graduation requirements, and are in good academic standing (2.0 GPA for Cal Poly Pomona coursework, 2.0 GPA in the major, and 2.0 for all cumulative coursework) at the end of the term prior to that in which the student applies to participate.</p> <p>Students who graduated in the summer and fall terms and applied to graduate for the spring term, will be included in the ceremonies.</p> <p>Students with only the Graduation Writing Test (GWT) to complete should contact the <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/admissions/testing-services/index.shtml">Office of Admissions</a> for available options.

Academic renewal is not available to graduate students.</p> <p>This policy is not intended to permit the improvement of an undergraduate's grade point average beyond what is required for graduation. Formal requests for Academic Renewal is made during the term in which the applicant plans to graduate.</p> <p>The following conditions must prevail:</p> 
                  <ol start="1"> 
                   <li>Five years have elapsed since the most recent work to be disregarded was completed and the student's GPA is too low to qualify for graduation.</li> 
                   <li>Since the completion of the work to be disregarded, the applicant has completed, at this university, 15 semester (22 quarter) units with at least a 3.0 GPA, 30 semester (45 quarter) units with at least a 2.5 GPA, or 45 semester (67 quarter) units with at least a 2.0 GPA. Work completed at any other institution shall not be used to satisfy this requirement.</li> 
                  </ol> <p>The student may formally request for the removal of work from degree consideration in a letter to the Committee on Academic Renewal through the Office of Student Success. The letter shall specify which semester(s) or quarter(s) of previous work are to be removed from consideration with supporting statements providing evidence that:</p> 
                  <ol start="1"> 
                   <li>The work under consideration is substandard and not representative of the student's present scholastic ability and level of performance.</li> 
                   <li>The level of performance represented by the work under consideration was due to described extenuating circumstances.</li> 
                   <li>All degree requirements except the earning of at least a "C" (2.0) grade point average have been met or will be met by the end of the term.</li> 
                  </ol> <p>If the committee acts favorably upon the request, the student's academic record will be annotated to show NO work taken during the disregarded term(s), even if satisfactory, has been applied towards the meeting of degree requirements. All work, whether or not discarded, will remain on the student's permanent academic record.</p> <p>If another institution has acted to remove coursework from consideration, such action shall be honored in terms of that institution's policy.&nbsp; Elimination of any coursework from degree consideration by another institution shall reduce by one term the two semester/three quarter maximum on the application of academic renewal to a student's record.</p> <h1><a name="Scholastic_Requirements"></a>Scholastic Requirements</h1> <p>Each student is expected to meet the academic standards required by the state, the university and by the instructor of a course. While class attendance is not recorded officially by the University, students are expected to attend all class meetings. Instructors' standards, particularly as they impact grades, must be explained in the syllabus made available in each class near the beginning of the term. It is the students' responsibility to make themselves aware of each faculty member's guidelines by carefully reading the syllabus.</p> <p>It is the student's responsibility to notify the instructor in advance of any planned absence and to request arrangements to make up academic work that is missed for any reason. The instructor is the judge of the validity of the reasons for absence and of what arrangements, if any, are to be provided for the student to make up class work. Instructors may require students to provide documentation for excused absences. It must be recognized that not all learning activities and exercises related to a class can be replicated.</p> <p>It is possible for a student to have three final examinations scheduled for the same day. If that happens, the student has the liberty of asking the instructor of the middle exam to pick a mutually convenient time for the exam.</p> <p>Students may not enroll in courses which have prerequisites without having successfully completed such prerequisites with the appropriate passing grade as designated by the offering department.</p> <p>Assignment of grades and change of grades are the prerogative of the instructor of record. Students may appeal grades that they consider to be unfair. See section on "Grade Appeals Policy" for more details.</p> <h1><a id="retention_of_student_work" name="retention_of_student_work"></a>Retention of Student Work</h1> <p>1.1 Student work refers to examinations and other materials, including materials in electronic form, which contribute to the student's final grade in a course and/or to the fulfillment of the requirements for a degree, program, or certification offered by the University. Duplicative copies in any format (such as digital or photographic copies) that preserve the content of the original work upon which grade evaluation is based are acceptable.</p> <p>1.2 Students have the right to examine their work even if the instructor chooses to retain it rather than return it. It is the student's responsibility to review their work within one academic term after a grade is assigned for the related course(s). If a student does not review their work within this time, the faculty has no further obligation to produce said work for student review. After one academic term, faculty members have the right to determine the method of disposal of the work. This disposal shall be in accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). For the purposes of this policy summer is not considered an academic term. If the instructor is on leave, on sabbatical, or is not currently on the faculty including those participating in the Faculty Early Retirement Program, the academic term in question is the term in which the faculty member returns.</p> <p>1.3 Student work pertaining to a grade appeal or other official review that is not completed must be retained until the appeal process is completed; provided the appeal process or other official review commenced within the academic term as defined in the subsection 1.2 of this policy.</p> <h1><a name="Academic_Standing"></a>ACADEMIC STANDING</h1> <h2>Academic Standing - Undergraduate Students</h2> <h3>1.0 Purpose</h3> <p>The purpose of this policy is to establish the criteria for assignment of Probationary and Disqualification academic standings to undergraduate students. The minimum requirements for academic probation and disqualification are established under Executive Order No. 1038, Sections 41300 and 41300.1 of Title 5 of the California Code of Regulations, and Chapter III, Sections 1 and 2 of the Standing Orders of the Board of Trustees of the California State University.</p> <h3>2.0 Good Standing</h3> <p>An undergraduate student is considered to be in good standing when a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 (C) for all university level work attempted and for all such work attempted at Cal Poly Pomona is earned.</p> <p>If a student's GPA remains below 2.0 for more than two consecutive terms, the student will not be certified for veteran educational benefits until the academic status of the student is restored to good standing.</p> <h3>3.0 Early Warning</h3> <p>All undergraduate students with a Cal Poly GPA or Major Core GPA of less than 2.2 will have an early warning/at-risk advising hold placed systematically on their record. These students will not be able to register until they have cleared this hold by completing the required advising intervention.</p> <h3>4.0 Academic Probation</h3> <p>An undergraduate student shall be placed on academic probation if at any time the cumulative grade point average in all college work attempted or cumulative grade point average for work attempted at Cal Poly Pomona falls below 2.0. The student shall be advised of probation status promptly. The first time an undergraduate student's cumulative grade point average in either work attempted at Cal Poly Pomona or for all college level work attempted falls below 2.0 they shall be placed on academic probation, even in circumstances where their GPA falls below the Probation with Contract thresholds as described under section 4.0 of this policy. An undergraduate student shall be removed from academic probation when the cumulative grade point average in all college work attempted, and the Cal Poly Pomona cumulative grade point average is 2.0 or higher. After the first occurrence of the GPA falling below 2.0, students may be placed into Probation with Contract standing as detailed in section 4.0 of this policy without first being placed on probation.</p> <h3>5.0&nbsp;Probation with Contract and Disqualification</h3> <p>After attempting 12 semester units at Cal Poly Pomona, an undergraduate student is considered to have Probation with Contract standing if at any time:</p> 
                  <ol start="1" style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"> 
                   <li>As a freshman (less than 30 semester units of college work completed) the student's cumulative grade point average falls below 1.50 in all units attempted at Cal Poly Pomona, or in all college level course work attempted overall.</li> 
                   <li>As a sophomore (30 through 59 semester units of college work completed) the student's cumulative grade point average falls below 1.70 for all units attempted at Cal Poly Pomona, or in all college level course work attempted overall.</li> 
                   <li>As a junior (60 through 89 semester units of college work completed) the student's cumulative grade point average falls below 1.85 for all units attempted at Cal Poly Pomona, or in all college level course work attempted overall.</li> 
                   <li>As a senior (90 or more semester units of college work completed) the student's cumulative grade point average falls below 1.95 for all units attempted at Cal Poly Pomona, or in all college level course work attempted overall.</li> 
                  </ol> <p>An undergraduate student who is assigned Probation with Contract standing will be permitted to attend for at least one term. These students shall be notified of their Probation with Contract Standing before the beginning of the term following the assignment of that academic standing. Students who have Probation with Contract standing at the beginning of a summer enrollment break shall be notified at least one month before the start of the fall term. The notification shall advise the student that the Probation with Contract standing is effective immediately. The notification shall include any conditions which, if met, will result in permission to continue in enrollment. Failure to notify students does not create the right of a student to continue enrollment.</p> <p>Students who have Probation with Contract standing have the right to be considered for continued enrollment each term. To do so, the student must complete the required advising interventions, meet with their advisor or retention and graduation specialist AND maintain a term GPA of a 2.0 or better each subsequent term. Students who have Probation with Contract standing may take no more than 13 units per term (12 in the summer) until their overall and Cal Poly Pomona grade point average is 2.0 or better. If students meet these criteria, they will be permitted to continue enrollment. If students do not meet these criteria, they will be academically disqualified.</p> <p>Students can fall into Disqualification in two ways:</p> 
                  <ol start="1"> 
                   <li>If students do not meet the term GPA of 2.0 or higher at the end of any term following their first Probation with Contract status, while they remain in Probation with Contract status.</li> 
                   <li>If, after a first Probation with Contract status, students successfully raise their CPP and Overall GPA above the Probation with Contract threshold, but then their GPA falls below the threshold in a subsequent term, they will be automatically disqualified from CPP. All academically disqualified students shall be notified of their disqualification.</li> 
                  </ol> <p>Students who do not attend two terms consecutively in one calendar year are considered to have broken continuous enrollment status.</p> <p>Students have the right to appeal their eligibility to enroll after Disqualification by contacting the Office of Student Success. Only in extraordinary circumstances will appeals be considered. A successful appeal request is considered a reinstatement. However, no reinstatement petition or advising contract is required. Students may not appeal a second disqualification.</p> <p>Upon initial disqualification, students may request consideration for reinstatement only after presentation to the university of satisfactory evidence that they have improved their chances of scholastic success. After reinstatement, students must maintain a grade point average of 2.0 or better each subsequent term and may take no more than 13 units until the overall and Cal Poly Pomona grade point average is 2.0 or better.</p> <h3>6.0 Administrative-Academic Probation</h3> <p>An undergraduate student may be placed on administrative-academic probation for any of the following reasons:</p> 
                  <ol start="1" style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"> 
                   <li>Withdrawal from more than two-thirds of a program of study in two successive terms or in any three terms. A student whose withdrawal is directly associated with a chronic or recurring medical condition or its treatment is not to be subject to Administrative-Academic probation for such withdrawal.</li> 
                   <li>Repeated failure to progress toward the stated degree objective or other program objective, including that resulting from assignment of 15 semester units of No Credit, when such failure appears to be due to circumstances within the control of the student.</li> 
                   <li>Failure to comply, after due notice, with an academic requirement or regulation, as defined by campus policy, which is routine for all students or a defined group of students (example: failure to complete a required CSU or campus examination, failure to complete a required practicum, failure to comply with professional standards appropriate to the field of study, failure to complete a specified number of units as a condition for receiving student financial aid or making satisfactory progress in the academic program) .</li> 
                  </ol> <p>When such action is taken, the student shall be notified in writing and shall be provided with the conditions for removal from probation and the circumstances that would lead to disqualification, should probation not be removed.</p> <h3>7.0 Administrative-Academic Disqualification</h3> <p>A student who has been placed on administrative-academic probation may be disqualified from further attendance if:</p> 
                  <ol start="1" style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"> 
                   <li>The conditions for removal of administrative-academic probation are not met with in the period specified.</li> 
                   <li>The student becomes subject to academic probation while on administrative-academic probation.</li> 
                   <li>The student becomes subject to administrative-academic probation for the same or similar reason for which they have been placed on administrative-academic probation previously, although not currently in such status.</li> 
                  </ol> <p>When a student has been placed on administrative-academic disqualification they shall receive written notification including an explanation of the basis for the action.</p> <p>In addition, the Office of Student Success may disqualify a student who at any time during enrollment has demonstrated behavior so contrary to the standards of the profession for which the student is preparing as to render them unfit for the profession. In such cases, disqualification will occur immediately upon notice to the student, which shall include an explanation of the basis for the action, and the campus may require the student to discontinue enrollment as of the date of the notification.</p> <h2>Academic Standing - Postbaccalaureate/Graduate Students</h2> <h3>1.0 Purpose</h3> <p>The purpose of this policy is to establish the criteria for assignment of probationary and disqualification academic standings to postbaccalaureate students. The minimum requirements for academic probation and disqualification are established under Executive Order No. 1038, Sections 41300 and 41300.1 of Title 5 of the California Code of Regulations, and Chapter III, Sections 1 and 2 of the Standing Orders of the Board of Trustees of the California State University. Probation and disqualification criteria of post-baccalaureate and graduate students may not be less than those established for undergraduate students.</p> <h3>2.0 Academic Probation</h3> <p>A postbaccalaureate student shall be placed on Probation if at any time the cumulative grade point average in all postbaccalaureate level course work attempted or cumulative grade point average for postbaccalaureate course work attempted at Cal Poly Pomona falls below 3.0. The student shall be promptly notified in writing of their probation status.</p> <p>The first time a postbaccalaureate student's cumulative grade point average in either postbaccalaureate course work attempted at Cal Poly Pomona or for all postbaccalaureate course work attempted overall falls below 3.0 they shall be placed on academic probation, even in circumstances where their GPA falls below the Probation with Contract thresholds as described under section 3.0 of this policy.</p> <p>A postbaccalaureate student shall be removed from academic probation when the cumulative grade point average in all postbaccalaureate course work attempted overall, and the Cal Poly Pomona cumulative grade point average is 3.0 or higher. The student shall be provided with any additional conditions for removal from probation and the circumstances that would lead to disqualification, should probation not be removed.</p> <p>After the first occurrence of the GPA falling below 3.0, postbaccalaureate students may be placed on Probation with Contract without first being put on probation.</p> <h3>3.0 Probation with Contract and Academic Disqualification</h3> <p>A postbaccalaureate student will be assigned Probation with Contract status if:</p>

                   <li>After the completion of 8 semester units of postbaccalaureate work, the student's cumulative grade point average falls below 2.3 for all postbaccalaureate work attempted at Cal Poly Pomona or for all postbaccalaureate work attempted overall.</li> 
                   <li>After the completion of 16 semester units of postbaccalaureate work, the student's cumulative grade point average falls below 2.7 for all postbaccalaureate work attempted at Cal Poly Pomona or for postbaccalaureate work attempted overall.</li> 
                   <li>After the completion of 24 semester units of postbaccalaureate work, the student's cumulative grade point average falls below 2.9 for all postbaccalaureate work attempted at Cal Poly Pomona or for all postbaccalaureate work attempted overall.</li> 
                  </ol> <p>A postbaccalaureate student who has Probation with Contract status will be permitted to attend at least one semester. These students shall be notified of their Probation with Contract standing before the beginning of the semester following the assignment of that academic standing. Students who have Probation with Contract standing at the beginning of a summer enrollment break shall be notified at least one month before the start of the fall term. The notification shall advise the student that the Probation with Contract is to be effective immediately. The notification shall include any conditions which, if met, will result in permission to continue in enrollment. Failure to notify students does not create the right of a student to continue enrollment.</p> <p>Students who have Probation with Contract standing have the right to be considered for continued enrollment each term. To do so, the student must meet with their graduate coordinator AND maintain a term GPA of a 3.0 or better each subsequent term. Students on Probation with Contract may take no more than 13 units per term until their overall and Cal Poly Pomona grade point average is 3.0 or better. If students meet these criteria, they will be permitted to continue enrollment. If students do not meet these criteria, they will be academically disqualified.</p> <p>Students can fall into Disqualification in two ways:</p> 
                  <ol start="1"> 
                   <li>If students do not meet the term GPA of 3.0 or higher at the end of any term following their first Probation with Contract status, while they remain in Probation with Contract status.</li> 
                   <li>If, after a first Probation with Contract status, students successfully raise their CPP and Overall GPA above the Probation with Contract threshold, but then their GPA falls below the threshold in a subsequent term.</li> 
                  </ol> <p>All academically disqualified postbaccalaureate students shall be notified of their disqualification before the beginning of the term following the assignment of that academic standing. Students disqualified at the beginning of a summer enrollment break shall be notified at least one month before the start of the fall term. The disqualification notification shall advise the student that the disqualification is to be effective immediately*. Failure to notify students does not create the right of a student to continue enrollment. Students will not be allowed to attend the term following academic disqualification.</p> <p>Students who do not attend two terms consecutively in one calendar year are considered to have broken continuous enrollment status.</p> <p>Students have the right to appeal their eligibility to enroll by after Disqualification by contacting the Office of Student Success. Only in extraordinary circumstances, will appeals be considered. A successful appeal request is considered a reinstatement. However, no reinstatement petition or advising contract is required. Students may not appeal a second disqualification. Students who are disqualified at the end of the spring semester shall have until the end of the following fall term to appeal.</p> <p>Upon initial disqualification, students may request consideration for reinstatement only after presentation to the university of satisfactory evidence that they have improved their chances of scholastic success. After reinstatement, students must maintain a grade point average of 3.0 or better each subsequent term and may take no more than 13 units until the overall and Cal Poly Pomona grade point average is 3.0 or better.</p> <p>All Academically Disqualified postbaccalaureate students shall be notified of their disqualification before the beginning of the term following the assignment of that academic standing. Students disqualified at the beginning of a summer enrollment break shall be notified at least one month before the start of the fall term. The disqualification notification shall advise the student that the disqualification is effective immediately. The disqualification notification shall include any conditions which, if met, will result in permission to continue in enrollment. Failure to notify students does not create the right of a student to continue enrollment.</p> <p>Postbaccalaureate and graduate students will normally be ineligible for reinstatement or readmission after a disqualification. However, in exceptional circumstances, a student may be allowed to petition for reinstatement or readmission after a disqualification.</p> <h3>4.0 Administrative-Academic Probation</h3> <p>A postbaccalaureate student may be placed on administrative-academic probation for any of the following reasons:</p> 
                  <ol start="1" style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"> 
                   <li>Withdrawal from more than two-thirds of a program of study in two successive term or in any three terms. A student whose withdrawal is directly associated with a chronic or recurring medical condition or its treatment is not to be subject to Administrative-Academic probation for such withdrawal.</li> 
                   <li>Repeated failure to progress toward the stated degree objective or other program objective, including that resulting from assignment of 15 semester units of No Credit, when such failure appears to be due to circumstances within the control of the student.</li> 
                   <li>Failure to comply, after due notice, with an academic requirement or regulation, as defined by campus policy, which is routine for all students or a defined group of students (example: failure to complete a required CSU or campus examination, failure to complete a required practicum, failure to comply with professional standards appropriate to the field of study, failure to complete a specified number of units as a condition for receiving student financial aid or making satisfactory progress in the academic program).</li> 
                  </ol> <p>When such action is taken, the student shall be notified in writing and shall be provided with the conditions for removal from probation and the circumstances that would lead to disqualification, should probation not be removed.</p> <h3>5.0 Administrative-Academic Disqualification</h3> <p>A student who has been placed on administrative-academic probation may be disqualified from further attendance if:</p> 
                  <ol start="1" style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"> 
                   <li>The conditions for removal of administrative-academic probation are not met with in the period specified.</li> 
                   <li>The student becomes subject to academic probation while on administrative-academic probation.</li> 
                   <li>The student becomes subject to administrative-academic probation for the same or similar reason for which they have been placed on administrative-academic probation previously, although not currently in such status.</li> 
                  </ol> <p>When a student has been placed on administrative-academic disqualification they shall receive written notification including an explanation of the basis for the action.</p> <p>In addition, the Office of Academic Programs may disqualify a student who at any time during enrollment has demonstrated behavior so contrary to the standards of the profession for which the student is preparing as to render him/her unfit for the profession. In such cases, disqualification will occur immediately upon notice to the student, which shall include an explanation of the basis for the action, and the campus may require the student to discontinue enrollment as of the specified date.</p> <h1><a id="academic_satisfactory_progress" name="academic_satisfactory_progress"></a>Academic Satisfactory Progress</h1> <p>Full-time undergraduate students are considered to be maintaining academic satisfactory progress toward their degree requirements when the student hascompleted a minimum of 24 units per academic year of which a minimum of 16 units directly apply to satisfying requirements of their major curriculum according to their Degree Progress Report (or until such time as all major requirements are satisfied). Good standing is defined as 2.0 or above GPA.</p> <p>Half-time students are considered to be maintaining academic satisfactory progress toward their degree requirements when they have completed a minimum of 18 units per academic year of which a minimum of 12 units directly apply to satisfying requirements of their major curriculum according to their Degree Progress Report (or until such time as all major requirements are satisfied).&nbsp;</p> <h1><a id="super_senior_policy" name="super_senior_policy"></a>Super Senior Policy</h1> <p>Super Seniors are students who have accumulated more than 100% of the units required for one or more of their academic majors.&nbsp; Excess Unit Seniors are students who have accumulated more than 125% of the units required for one or more of their academic majors (and have earned at least 90 units at Cal Poly Pomona). Excess Unit Seniors receive a registration hold each term until the student graduates. The first term the student receives such a hold, they are expected to meet with a designated advisor in their department to complete a&nbsp;Graduation Plan Worksheet. Each subsequent term Excess Unit Seniors are expected to meet with their advisor to discuss their progress.&nbsp;</p> <p>If an Excess Unit Senior fails to follow the Graduation Plan and does not have a reasonable explanation for doing so, the student may be placed on academic/administrative probation by the Associate Dean of the College. If the student continues to deviate from the Plan without cause, the student may be forwarded to Office of Student Success for possible academic/administrative disqualification.</p> <h1><a id="Change_of_Major" name="Change_of_Major"></a>Change of Major</h1> <p>Academic and career advising are highly recommended so that change of major decisions are well-informed and additional time and units to completing the degree are minimized. Changes to a new major should be considered as early as possible in the students' academic career. Students who are unsure about which major to pursue may contact the Career Center for career counseling to narrow their choice of potential majors.</p> <p>Academic advising appointments and/or change of major meetings may be required to ensure that a student has the potential to succeed in the selected major. Students changing their major are subject to the major/minor requirements in effect at the time of the change. Transferring from one major to another does not in any way change the student's academic standing, nor does it constitute a break in continuous enrollment. See the General Education section in this catalog regarding transfer and change of major students and GE certification.</p> <p>Undergraduate students declaring a major for the first time or students changing from one degree program to another must submit a Petition to Change Major Curriculum to the Registrar's Office. This form is available on the Registrar's Office webpage under "Forms."</p> <h6>Undeclared Students</h6> <p>Undergraduate students who have entered the university with an undeclared major should work with their undeclared advisor to ensure that they meet the requirements for the intended major and submit a declaration of major form by the deadlines. Students may not change from a major to undeclared major status.</p> <h6>Military-affiliated Students</h6> <p>Students receiving military benefits should consult with the certifying official and obtain approval by the Veterans Administration before a change of major can be made.</p> <h6>International Students</h6> <p>International students are required to notify the International Student Advisor after changing majors so that the student's immigration documents can be updated.</p> <h6>Non-impacted Majors</h6> <p>Non-impacted Majors: Lower-division students requesting a change of major must be in good academic standing (i.e., 2.0 grade point average for all college-level work attempted, all Cal Poly Pomona work attempted, and all work attempted in the major).</p> <p>Additional requirements for change of major may be established for upper-division students. In addition to good academic status, upper-division students may be required to meet a minimum number of units or complete specific courses with grades of C or better to qualify for a change of major. Specific requirements are available at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cpp.edu/~studentsuccess/guides/change-of-major.shtml.">https://www.cpp.edu/~studentsuccess/guides/change-of-major.shtml.</a></p> <p>Change of major petitions for non-impacted majors may be submitted at any time during the term. However, change of major petitions must be submitted no later than the end of the fourth week of the term to be effective in the following term.</p> <h6>Impacted Majors</h6> <p>Lower-division and upper-division students requesting a change of major to an impacted program must meet the supplemental requirements required for that major. Acceptance into the new program will be on the same basis as for new applicants. This policy is subject to further change and students are advised to check with the Registrar's Office for up-to-date information. Students are advised to check with the department office of the major in which they are interested in declaring.</p> <p>Students requesting a change of major into an impacted program must file the required change of major petition no later than the last day of the initial application period for the term of the desired change (i.e., November 30 for fall; August 31 for spring).</p> <p><u>Closures or Limits of Changes of Major:</u>&nbsp;Departments may close or limit changes of major for a specific term to ensure that the number of students in that major can be accommodated.</p> <h1><a id="double_majors" name="double_majors"></a>Declaration of Minors and Double Majors</h1> <p>Students may declare up to two minors in addition to their primary major if all academic programs can be completed within&nbsp;24 semester units&nbsp;above the number of units required for their primary major.&nbsp; Students must receive the approval of the chair of the department offering the proposed academic program.</p> <p>Students may declare one major in addition to their primary major if all academic programs can be completed within&nbsp;32 semester units&nbsp;above the number of units required for their primary major.&nbsp; Students must receive the approval from the chair of the department offering the proposed academic program.</p> <p>Minors or double majors may be declared at any time in a students' career but students are strongly encourage to declare minors and double majors early in their career.&nbsp; After earning 90 totals units, students may declare a minor or additional major only if they are in good academic standing and have the approval from the chair of the department offering the proposed academic program.</p> <p>Students must submit a Declare or Drop a Minor Form to declare/drop a minor or Change of Major Option Form to declare a double major to the Registrar's Office.&nbsp; These forms are available on the Registrar's Office webpage under "<a href="https://www.cpp.edu/registrar//forms/index.shtml">Forms</a>."</p> <p>Credits from transfer units, non-traditional college-level work (including AP, IB, and CLEP examinations, and credit by challenge examinations), and military service in excess of 40 semester units shall be excluded from the unit count for the purposes of the minor and double major policies.*</p> <p>Students may request exceptions to the minor and double major policy by making an appointment with an academic advisor to initiate a <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/registrar/forms/forms.shtml">General Academic Petition</a>.</p> <p>*Students often have credits from these sources that are not applicable to their Cal Poly Pomona degree program for a variety of reasons, including unfamiliarity with how tertiary education works (especially first generation college students), poor advising at Community College, exploration/change of career direction, credits for sports, etc.&nbsp; The intention of this policy is to count up to 40 semester units that likely fulfill GE and academic program requirements at Cal Poly Pomona without prohibiting transfer students from minoring or double majoring if they have a large number of units that do not further their Cal Poly Pomona degree.</p> <h1><a name="Transfer_Credit"></a>Transfer Credit</h1> <p>A student who has attended an accredited two-year or four-year college&nbsp;will be given full credit for college level courses successfully completed. Credit for courses taken at other institutions count&nbsp;toward fulfillment of curriculum requirements when applicable; other courses count as elective credit. Cal Poly Pomona does not accept credit for courses in religious practices.</p> <p>A maximum of 70 semester units (105 quarter units) of community college course credit may be applied toward the bachelor's degree. No credit may be allowed for professional courses in education taken at a community college.</p> <p>A maximum of 24 semester&nbsp;units of extended university course credit may be applied toward the bachelor's degree. Students taken over the 24 semester units college level transferable limit through Cal Poly Pomona or other Continuing Education or Extended Education programs or Open University coursework may satisfy a specific course requirement, but only 24 semester units may be considered by the university as transferable college level work that counts towards satisfying the minimum units required for a degree.</p> <p>No limit is placed upon the number of transferable credits from a four year college or university, except that no student will be granted a bachelor's degree in any curriculum without having met the general unit, grade, and residence requirements.</p> <p>No credit will be given for work taken at an unaccredited (non-regionally accredited) institution until the student has successfully completed 20 semester units of work at Cal Poly Pomona. At that time, and upon recommendation of the student's major department via approval of a petition, transfer credits may be granted for the unaccredited work.</p> <p>Once a student has commenced work at Cal Poly Pomona, approval from advisor is required prior to taking courses at another institution for credits toward major requirements at this university.

                  </table> <h1><a name="Credit_Hour"></a>Credit Hour</h1> <p>On July 1, 2020, the United States Department of Education changed its definition of the student credit hour. Fundamentally, the change now shifts responsibility for credit hour compliance to the accreditation agency and/or to the state.</p> <p>As such, the CSU's accreditor, the WASC Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC), has published its own updated definition of student credit hour and related accreditation processes. The new regulations no longer require an accrediting agency to review an institution's credit hour policy and procedures. It does require the WSCUC to review the institution's definition of credit hour and (as a newly introduced practice) an institutions' processes and policies for ensuring the credit hour policy is followed.</p> <p>The CSU credit hour definition is consistent with federal law (600.2 and 600.4 revised July 1, 2020) and the requirements of the WSCUC. The CSU defines a credit hour as an amount of work represented in stated learning outcomes and verified by evidence of student achievement. Such evidence is an institutionally established equivalency that:</p> 
                  <ol start="1"> 
                   <li>Approximates not less than: 
                    <ol start="1" style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"> 
                     <li>One hour of direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out-of-class student work each week for approximately 15 weeks for one semester or equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time; or</li> 
                     <li>At least an equivalent amount of work as required in paragraph 1.a. of this definition for other academic activities as established by the institution including laboratory work, internships, practica, studio work and other academic work leading to the award of credit hours; and</li> 
                    </ol> </li> 
                   <li>Permits an institution, in determining the amount of work associated with a credit hour, to take into account a variety of delivery methods, measurements of student work, academic calendars, disciplines and degree levels. Institutions have the flexibility to award a greater number of credits for courses that require more student work.</li> 
                  </ol> <p>As in the past, a credit hour is assumed to be a 50-minute (not 60-minute) period. In some courses, such as those offered online, in which "seat time" does not apply, a credit hour may be measured by an equivalent amount of work, as demonstrated by student achievement.</p> <p>For purposes of accreditation, all CSU campuses are required to develop, communicate and implement procedures for regular, periodic review of this credit hour policy to ensure that credit hour assignments are accurate, reliable and consistently applied. WSCUC published new draft guidelines that will take effect in June 2021. Campuses will be responsible (effective summer 2021) for publishing a clearly stated practice or process that ensures they are in compliance with the student credit hour definition.</p> <p>Compliance review of the credit hour policy is conducted at the time of the periodic academic program review process. New or revised academic programs will be reviewed for compliance with the credit hour policy by the Associate Vice President for Academic Programs.</p> <h1><a name="Grading_System__See_also__Graduate_Studies__section_"></a>Grading System</h1> <p>The university uses a basic four-point system when assigning grades to students. Grade points assigned for each grade are: A, four points; B, three points; C, two points; D, one point; F, zero points. Plus and minus grading symbols are granted [CK1]&nbsp;at the discretion of the instructor with the exclusion of an A+. Grades of CR, NC, I, IC, RP, W, AU, WU, and RD are also assigned.</p>

Occasionally, a circumstance will prevent assignment of an earned grade or will cause an assigned grade to be questioned by a student.</p> <p>The following policy has been adopted by Cal Poly Pomona to provide the mechanism to deal with such unusual occurrences:</p> <p>Course grades assigned by instructors are presumed to be correct. It is the responsibility of the student who appeals an assigned grade to demonstrate clerical error, prejudice, or capriciousness in the assignment of the grade, or that a reasonable accommodation for a documented disability was requested and not appropriately provided; otherwise, the judgment of the instructor is final.</p> <p>A student who believes that a course grade has been assigned inappropriately must follow the proper steps in the appeal process, observing the time limits for completion of various steps in the process as follows:</p> <p>Step 1: The student should speak face-to-face with the instructor during the first three weeks of the term following the assignment of the grade. If the grade is assigned in the spring term, the student should follow these procedures in the following fall term. If the instructor is on leave, on sabbatical, or is not currently on the faculty including FERP faculty at the time of the appeal, the University shall attempt to contact the instructor on behalf of the student.<strong>*</strong></p> <p>If an appointment cannot be arranged, the student should attempt to communicate with the instructor by phone, e-mail or fax. If a grade has been assigned in error, the instructor can quickly correct the error by submitting a change of grade form to the Registrar's Office.</p> <p><strong>*</strong><span class="footnote_text">The grade appeal process is suspended during the summer when fewer students and faculty members are expected to be on campus. The grade appeal process is also suspended if the faculty member is on leave or on sabbatical. Thus, for spring semester, "the following term" will be the following fall term. For appeals of summer grades, the following semester&nbsp;is the following fall term. For appeals when the faculty member is either on leave or on sabbatical "the following term" is the term the faculty member returns to CPP.</span></p> <p>Step 2: If the grade dispute is not resolved with the instructor and the student intends to appeal the grade, the student must appeal to the next level as soon as possible, but no later than the sixth week of the following term. In most cases, the student will appeal to the chair of the academic department that offered the class. If the instructor is a department chair, the student should appeal to the dean of the college that offered the class. If the instructor is a dean, the student should appeal to the Provost. The person to whom the student appealed will discuss the issue with the instructor and respond to the student, usually within two weeks.</p> <p>Step 3: If the student is still not satisfied after receiving the response from this second level of appeal, the student may submit a written statement within ten working days to the University Course Grade Appeal Committee through the Office of the Student Success. The formal grade appeal should be submitted prior to the end of the regular term following the term for which the grade was assigned.</p> <p>Step 4: The Chair of the University Course Grade Appeal Committee will forward the student's statement to the instructor. The instructor will be asked to respond in writing by a specified date (normally within two weeks). The student's statement and the instructor's response will then be reviewed by the entire committee, normally within two weeks of receipt of the instructor's response.</p> <p>The Committee will take one of the following actions:</p> 
                  <ol start="1" style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"> 
                   <li>Request additional information from the student and/or the instructor.</li> 
                   <li>If the University Course Grade Appeal Committee finds that the student has grounds for complaint based on discrimination, caprice, or clerical error, then the instructor of record will be asked to reevaluate the grade. If the instructor refuses to reevaluate the grade or the instructor's reevaluation results in the same grade, then the chair of the academic department that offered the class shall be asked to find a qualified faculty member with academic training comparable to the instructor of record to evaluate the student's work and assign a grade. If the instructor is a department chair, the dean of the college that offered the class shall be asked to find a qualified faculty member with academic training comparable to the instructor of record to evaluate the student's work and assign a grade. If the instructor is a dean, the Provost shall be asked to find a qualified faculty member with academic training comparable to the instructor of record to evaluate the student's work and assign a grade.</li> 
                   <li>Recommend to the instructor that the grade be maintained as given.</li> 
                   <li>Call for a formal hearing.</li> 
                  </ol> <p>Step 5: When the Committee has made its recommendation, the student will be notified of it in writing, and be given a copy of the instructor's written response to the student's statement. This grade appeal procedure may take six to eight weeks to complete. The outcome of the formal grade appeal procedure is final; there is no higher level of appeal.</p> <p>The Office of Student Success shall ensure that the university website, catalog and other publications reflect this policy.

                  <ul> 
                   <li>Students will be prevented from registering for a course in which a grade of C or higher&nbsp;has been assigned.<strong>*</strong></li> 
                   <li>Undergraduate students are limited to 28 semester units of course repetition through regular enrollment.</li> 
                   <li>Courses repeated prior to Fall 2009 that are included in the calculation of the GPA (not forgiven)&nbsp;will not&nbsp;contribute to this limit. However, units of courses taken prior to Fall 2009 that have been "forgiven" will contribute to this 28 semester unit limit.</li> 
                   <li>Undergraduate students may attempt to improve their GPA by repeating a course.</li> 
                   <li>Only grades of C-, D+, D, D- F, WU or IC may be repeated and forgiven (excluded from GPA calculation).</li> 
                   <li>The course can be repeated no more than two times for a maximum of three attempts. The number of repeats of individual courses prior to Fall 2009 will contribute to this 2 repetition (3 attempts) limit. &nbsp;</li> 
                   <li>Withdrawing from a class and receiving a W grade is&nbsp;<strong>NOT&nbsp;</strong>considered an attempt. Such attempts will&nbsp;<strong>NOT</strong>&nbsp;be taken into account when determining how many times a student has taken a course, and in the calculation of the 28 semester unit course repetition limit.</li> 
                   <li>Grades received in courses taken through Extended Education in excess of the 28 semester unit limit can be used to satisfy content and prerequisite requirements, but will not be used in GPA calculations. These courses will appear on the student's transcript.</li> 
                   <li>Students may request waivers of this policy. A waiver will be granted only to students with a minimum overall GPA of 2.0 and documentation of demonstrated effort. Courses explicitly designated as repeatable in the University Catalog are not included in this policy. In order to be considered for a waiver, students must submit a Petition to Waiver Restriction on Course Repeats with the necessary approval signatures to the Office of Student Success.</li> 
                   <li>Courses explicitly designated as repeatable in the University Catalog are not included in this policy.<br> <br> <strong>*</strong><span class="footnote_text">Students may subsequently repeat a course with a CR grade earned in Spring 2020 for a letter grade.</span></li> 
                  </ul> <h1><a name="Grade_Forgiveness"></a>Grade Forgiveness</h1> <p>Students may receive Grade Forgiveness through course repetition. When a grade is forgiven due to course repetition, the grade and units for the excluded course work will not be used in the calculation of the grade point average and the units will not be used to satisfy the requirements toward graduation. The excluded course work will remain on the student's permanent record, but will be annotated as excluded from the grade point average through grade forgiveness.</p> 
                  <ul> 
                   <li>Effective Fall 2018, Grade Forgiveness through course repetition is automatically invoked when a student repeats the course if the new grade is better than the original grade. If a student retakes an eligible class in which the student earned a grade of C- or lower, grade forgiveness will automatically apply as long as the student had remaining units. (See note below for Grade Forgiveness prior to Fall 2018.)</li> 
                   <li>Grade Forgiveness through course repetition is limited to 16-semester units. These 16 semester units contribute to the 28 semester unit limit for course repetition.<strong>*</strong></li> 
                   <li>Students may repeat an additional 12 units for grade replacement, meaning the repeat grade will not nullify the original grade, and both grades will be factored into the student GPAs.</li> 
                   <li>Units of courses where grade forgiveness has already been applied prior to Fall 2009 will contribute to the 16 semester unit limit.</li> 
                   <li>For students who wish to repeat a quarter course under semesters, or a course that has undergone a number change, the Grade Forgiveness through Course Repetition Form should be filed to that effect. Such petitions should be approved as a matter of course, assuming all existing conditions for grade forgiveness apply.</li> 
                   <li>Grade Forgiveness can be applied only to courses taken for undergraduate credit and before awarding of a bachelor's degree.</li> 
                   <li>Grade forgiveness shall not apply to courses for which the original grade was the result of a finding of academic dishonesty. For advisement purposes, the letter J will be affixed after the grade awarded to the student in the class in question, e.g., D+J for a grade of D+. The suffix J will not appear on official transcripts.</li> 
                   <li>A Cal Poly Pomona course may be used to forgive the grade of a course taken at another institution if the two courses are determined to be equivalent by the chair of the department offering the CPP course. Courses taken at other institutions cannot be used to forgive the grade of a course taken at Cal Poly Pomona.</li> 
                   <li>A Challenged Course cannot be used as a repetition of a regularly enrolled course.&nbsp;</li> 
                   <li>Students that prefer to use grade forgiveness differently than facilitated by automatic grade forgiveness, a general academic petition may be filed to this effect.</li> 
                   <li>Students and advisors will be able to view on BroncoDirect the number of units repeated and forgiven.</li> 
                   <li>Effective Fall 2009, the grade forgiveness policy will apply to IC grades.<br> <br> <strong>*</strong><span class="footnote_text">Units earned for a repeated course in Spring 2020 shall be excluded from the 16-semester unit maximum for grade forgiveness.</span></li> 
                  </ul> <p>For course taken prior to Fall 2018, Grade Forgiveness through course repetition will only be automatically applied when:</p> 
                  <ul> 
                   <li>A quarter course forgave the same quarter course</li> 
                   <li>A semester course forgives a quarter course that was a 1:1 conversion equivalent in the semester conversion guide</li> 
                   <li>A semester course forgives a quarter course that was included as part of a department memo on grade forgiveness for Many: 1 and&nbsp; 1: Many courses.</li>
