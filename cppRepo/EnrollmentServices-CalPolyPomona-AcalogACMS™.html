A minimum of 30 semester units must be taken in residence and, of the 30 units, 24 shall be earned in upper division courses with 12 of these upper division units being in courses in the major.</p> <p>Advanced standing will be granted for work completed for the original baccalaureate degree as applicable to the new degree objective. Work completed at this university prior to awarding of the original baccalaureate degree shall be counted as appropriate toward the residence requirements for the second degree. Any change in general degree requirements (such as general education) will have to be met in order to receive the second baccalaureate degree.</p> <h2><a id="Transfer_Policies_of_CSU_Campuses" name="Transfer_Policies_of_CSU_Campuses"></a>Transfer Policies of CSU campuses</h2> <p>Most commonly, college-level credits earned from an institution of higher education accredited by a regional accrediting agency are accepted for transfer to campuses of the CSU; however, authority for decisions regarding the transfer of undergraduate credits is delegated to each CSU campus.</p> <p>California Community Colleges and other authorized certifying institutions can certify up to 39 semester (58.5 quarter) units of General Education-Breadth (GE-Breadth) or 37 semester (55.5 quarter) units of the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (IGETC) for transfer students to fulfill lower-division general education requirements for any CSU campus prior to transfer.</p> <p>"Certification" is the official notification from a California Community College or authorized institution that a transfer student has completed courses fulfilling lower-division general education requirements. The CSU GE-Breadth and the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (IGETC) certification course lists for particular community colleges can be accessed on the official transfer and articulation system for California's public colleges and universities website, <a href="https://www.assist.org/">assist.org</a>.</p> <p>CSU campuses may enter into course-to-course or program-to-program articulation agreements with other CSU campuses, any or all of the California community colleges and other regionally accredited institutions. Established CSU and CCC articulations may be found on <a href="https://www.assist.org/">assist.org</a>. Students may be permitted to transfer no more than 70 semester (105 quarter) units to a CSU campus from an institution which does not offer bachelor's degrees or their equivalents, for example, community colleges. Given the university's 30-semester (45-quarter) unit residency requirement, no more than a total of 90 semester (135 quarter) units may be transferred into the university from all sources.</p> <h2><a id="Undergraduate_Transfer_Admission_Requirements" name="Undergraduate_Transfer_Admission_Requirements"></a>Undergraduate Transfer Requirements</h2> <p>Applicants who have completed fewer than 60 transferable semester college units (fewer than 90 quarter units) are considered lower-division transfer students. Applicants who have completed 60 or more transferable semester college units (90 or more quarter units) are considered upper-division transfer students. Applicants who complete college units during high school or through the summer immediately following high school graduation are considered first-time freshmen and must meet the CSU minimum eligibility requirements for first-time freshman admission. Transferable courses are those designated for baccalaureate credit by the college or university offering the courses and accepted as such by the campus to which the applicant seeks admission.</p> <h3>Lower-Division Transfer Requirements</h3> <p>Due to increased enrollment demands, most CSU campuses do not admit lower-division transfer applicants.</p> <p>An applicant who completes fewer than 60 semester (90 quarter) units of college credit is considered a lower-division transfer student. Due to enrollment pressures, most CSU campuses do not admit lower-division transfers so that more upper-division transfers can be accommodated.</p> <p>Having fewer than 60 semester (90 quarter) units at the point of transfer may affect eligibility for registration priority at CSU campuses and may affect the student's financial aid status.<br> California resident transfer applicants with fewer than 60 semester or 90 quarter units must:</p> 
                  <ul> 
                   <li>Have a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 (C) or better in all transferable units attempted;</li> 
                   <li>Have completed, with a grade of C- or better, a course in written communication and a course in mathematics or quantitative reasoning at a level satisfying CSU General Education Breadth Area A2 and B4 requirements, respectively;</li> 
                   <li>Be in good standing at the last institution attended; and</li> 
                   <li>Meet any one of the following eligibility standards.</li> 
                  </ul> <p><u><strong>Transfer Based on Current Admission Criteria</strong></u></p> <p>The applicant meets the freshman admission requirements in effect for the term for which the application is filed; - OR -</p> <p><u><strong>Transfer Based on High School Eligibility</strong></u></p> <p>The applicant was eligible as a freshman at the time of high school graduation and has been in continuous attendance in an accredited college since high school graduation; - OR -</p> <p><u><strong>Transfer Based on Making Up Missing Subjects</strong></u></p> <p>The applicant had a qualifiable eligibility index at the time of high school graduation (combination of GPA and test scores if needed), has made up any missing college preparatory subject requirements with a grade of C- or better, and has been in continuous attendance in an accredited college since high school graduation.</p> <p>One baccalaureate-level course of at least 3 semester (4 quarter) units is usually considered equivalent to one year of high school study.</p> <p>(Note: Some campuses may require lower-division transfer students to complete specific college coursework, for example the four basic skill courses, as part of their admission criteria.)</p> <h3>Upper Division Transfer Requirements</h3> <p>Generally, applicants will qualify for consideration for upper-division transfer admission if they meet all of the following requirements:</p> 
                  <ol start="1"> 
                   <li>Cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0 in all transferable units attempted;</li> 
                   <li>In good standing at the last college or university attended; and</li> 
                   <li>Completed at least sixty (60) transferable semester (90 quarter) units of college level coursework with a grade point average of 2.0 or higher and a grade C- or better in each course used to meet the CSU general education requirements in written communication, oral communication, critical thinking, and quantitative reasoning, e.g. mathematics.</li> 
                  </ol> <p>The 60 units must include at least 30 units of courses that meet CSU general education requirements, including all of the general education requirements in communication in the English language (both oral and written) and critical thinking and the requirement in mathematics/quantitative reasoning (usually 3 semester units) OR the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (IGETC) requirements in English communication and mathematical concepts and quantitative reasoning.</p> <h3>Associate Degrees for Transfer (AA-T or AS-T)</h3> <p>The Associate in Arts for Transfer (AA-T) and the Associate in Science for Transfer (AS-T) degrees offered at the California Community Colleges (CCC) are designed to provide a California community college student the optimum transfer preparation and a clear admission pathway to the CSU degree majors.</p> <p>CCC students who earn an Associate Degree for Transfer (AA-T or AS-T) are guaranteed admission with junior standing to a CSU and given priority admission over other transfer applicants when applying to a local CSU campus or non-impacted CSU program. AA-T or AS- T admission applicants are given limited priority consideration based on their eligibility ranking to an impacted campus/program or to campuses/programs that have been deemed similar to the degree completed at the community college. Students who have completed an AA-T/AS-T in a program deemed similar to a CSU major are able to complete remaining requirements for graduation within 60 semester (90 quarter) units. It is the responsibility of the student who has earned an AA-T/AS-T to provide documentation of the degree to the CSU campus.</p> <p>For more information on Cal Poly Pomona's impaction policy refer to the <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/admissions/index.shtml">Admissions website.</a></p> <h3>Credit Awarded Through Associate Degrees for Transfer</h3> <p>When within the Associate Degree for Transfer (AA-T/AS-T), a California Community College awards course equivalency credit for a CSU-approved standardized external examination - and the student's transcript is annotated to reflect the course to which credit was earned by examination - the CSU campus shall accept the course units awarded. These units shall be applied toward the lower-division minimum unit requirement for the CSU degree and, if applicable, toward meeting the minimum unit designation for the CSU major or CSU GE-Breadth requirements.</p> <h3>Provisional Admission Transfer Applicants</h3> <p>Cal Poly Pomona may provisionally or conditionally admit transfer applicants based on their academic preparation and courses planned for completion. The campus will monitor the final terms to ensure that those admitted complete all required courses satisfactorily. All accepted applicants are required to submit an official transcript of all college-level work completed. Campuses may rescind admission for any student who is found to be ineligible after the final transcript has been evaluated. In no case may such documents be received and validated by the university any later than a student's registration for their second term of CSU enrollment.</p> <h3>Important Requirements for Admitted Transfers</h3> 
                  <ol start="1"> 
                   <li>Student Intent to Register and Enrollment Deposit - A Student Intent to Register (SIR) response and an enrollment confirmation deposit is now required of all admitted undergraduate applicants. Applicants who respond past the enrollment deposit deadline may be placed on an enrollment waiting list, deferred to a subsequent term, not permitted to register, or have their admission withdrawn.</li> 
                   <li>Document Deadlines - Applicants provisionally admitted who do not meet the final document deadline (see <span style="font-family:calibri,sans-serif; font-size:11.0pt; line-height:107%; mso-ansi-language:EN-US; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:Arial; mso-bidi-language:AR-SA; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi; mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri; mso-fareast-language:EN-US; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin"><a href="https://www.cpp.edu/admissions/transfer/admitted.shtml">https://www.cpp.edu/admissions/transfer/admitted.shtml</a></span>) may have their admission rescinded and may not be eligible to enroll in the fall term.</li> 
                   <li>Orientation - It is mandatory for all incoming transfer students to attend orientation. Admitted students will receive information (from the Department of Orientation Services) regarding orientation following admission. Transfer orientation is a 1-day program.</li> 
                  </ol> <h2><a id="Early_Start_Program" name="Early_Start_Program">Early Start Program</a></h2> <p>The Early Start Program (ESP) serves CSU admitted freshmen who have not demonstrated proficiency in written communication and/or mathematics/quantitative reasoning as determined by systemwide placement standards. Participation in the Early Start Program is required for students needing skill&nbsp;development in these areas; students will be expected to enroll in a written communication course or a mathematics/quantitative reasoning course (but not both) during the summer period prior to the start of the fall term. Students required to participate in the Early Start Program may choose to enroll at any CSU campus; the earned baccalaureate credit will be transferred seamlessly to the student's destination campus.</p> <p>The goal of the Early Start Program is to:</p> 
                  <ul> 
                   <li>Better prepare students in written composition and mathematics/quantitative reasoning before the fall term of freshman year, improving students' chances of successful completion of a baccalaureate degree.</li> 
                   <li>If required to participate in ESP, as determined by multiple measures, students will begin in the summer before the start of the freshman year.</li> 
                   <li>For general information about ESP including fees and course listings, visit <a href="http://www.csustudentsuccess.org/earlystart">www.csustudentsuccess.org/earlystart</a>. Students are encouraged to visit the campus website for ESP information once admitted.</li> 
                   <li>Eligible financial aid applicants with an Estimated Family Contribution (EFC) or $5,000 or less will be eligible for waiver of the per unit ESP fee. For more information on assessments, placements and the Early Start Program, please visit www.csustudentsuccess.org.</li> 
                  </ul> <h2><a id="Early_Assessment_Program" name="Early_Assessment_Program">Early Assessment Program</a></h2> <p>The Early Assessment Program (EAP) is a collaborative effort among the State Board of Education (SBE), the California Department of Education (CDE) and the California State University (CSU). The goal of the EAP program is to have California high school graduates enter the CSU fully prepared to begin college-level study.</p> <p>More than 60 percent of the nearly 40,000 first-time freshmen admitted to the CSU require remedial education in English, mathematics or both. EAP provides an early signal to high school officials, students, and families as to where the 11th grader is positioned in relation to college level math and English and often affords an opportunity in 12 grade to address any deficiencies.</p> <h2><a id="Graduate_and_Postbaccalaureate_Admission_Requirements" name="Graduate_and_Postbaccalaureate_Admission_Requirements">Graduate and Postbaccalaureate Admission Requirements</a></h2> <h3>Admission Requirements</h3> <p>Graduate and post-baccalaureate applicants may apply for a degree objective, a credential or certificate objective, or where approved, may have no program objective. Depending on the objective, the CSU will consider an application for admission as follows:</p> 
                  <ul> 
                   <li>General Requirements - The minimum requirements for admission to graduate and post-baccalaureate studies at a CSU campus are in accordance with university regulations as well as Title 5, Chapter 1, Subchapter 3 of the California Code of Regulations. 
                    <ul> 
                     <li>Specifically, a student shall at the time of enrollment: (1) have completed a four-year college course of study and hold an acceptable baccalaureate degree from an institution accredited by a regional accrediting association, or shall have completed equivalent academic preparation as determined by appropriate campus authorities; (2) be in good academic standing at the last college or university attended; (3) have earned a grade point average of at least 2.5 on the last degree completed by the candidate or have attained a grade point average of at least 2.5 (A=4.0) in the last 60 semester (90 quarter) units attempted; and (4) satisfactorily meet the professional, personal, scholastic, and other standards for graduate study, including qualifying examinations, as appropriate campus authorities may prescribe. In unusual circumstances, a campus may make exceptions to these criteria.</li> 
                     <li>Students who meet the minimum requirements for graduate and post-baccalaureate studies may be considered for admission in one of the four following categories: 
                      <ul> 
                       <li>Graduate Classified - To pursue a graduate degree, applicants are required to fulfill all of the professional, personal, scholastic, and other standards, including qualifying examinations, prescribed by the campus; or</li> 
                       <li>Graduate Conditionally Classified - Applicants may be admitted to a graduate degree program in this category if, in the opinion of appropriate campus authority, deficiencies may be remedied by additional preparation; or</li> 
                       <li>Post-Baccalaureate Classified (e.g. admission to an education credential program) - Persons wishing to enroll in a credential or certificate program will be required to satisfy additional professional, personal, scholastic, and other standards, including qualifying examinations, prescribed by the campus; or</li> 
                       <li>Post-Baccalaureate Unclassified - To enroll in undergraduate courses as preparation for advanced degree programs or to enroll in graduate courses for professional or personal growth, applicants must be admitted as post- baccalaureate unclassified students. By meeting the general requirements, applicants are eligible for admission as post-baccalaureate unclassified students. Admission in this status does not constitute admission to, or assurance of consideration for admission to, any graduate degree or credential program. (Most CSU campuses do not offer admission to unclassified post-baccalaureate students).</li> 
                      </ul> </li> 
                    </ul> </li> 
                  </ul> <p><em>(These and other CSU admission requirements are subject to change as policies are revised and laws are amended. The <a href="http://www.calstate.edu/">CSU website</a> and the <a href="http://www.calstate.edu/apply">admission portal</a> are good sources for the most up-to-date information.)</em></p> <h3>Graduate and Post-Baccalaureate English Language Requirement</h3> <p>All graduate and post-baccalaureate applicants, regardless of citizenship, whose native language is not English and whose preparatory education was principally in a language other than English must demonstrate competence in English. Those who do not possess a bachelor's degree from a postsecondary institution where English is the principal language of instruction must receive a minimum score of 550 Paper Based, 213 Computer Based, or 80 Internet Based on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). Some programs require a higher score. Several CSU campuses may use alternative methods for assessing fluency in English including Pearson Test of English Academic (PTE Academic), the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) and the International Test of English Proficiency (ITEP), and Duolingo.</p> <p>The minimum TOEFL scores for the Urban and Regional Planning programs are 580 Paper Based, 237 Computer Based, or 92-93 Internet Based on the TOEFL. The master's program in English requires a minimum score of 585 Paper Based, 238 Computer Based, or 100 Internet Based on the TOEFL. The International English Language Testing System (IELTS) is an acceptable measure of English Language Proficiency. All graduate students should contact their graduate coordinators in their intended major as requirements may vary.</p> <h2><a id="International_Foreign_Student_Admission_Requirements" name="International_Foreign_Student_Admission_Requirements">International (Foreign) Student Admission Requirements</a></h2> <p>The CSU must assess the academic preparation of foreign students. For this purpose, "foreign students" include those who hold U.S. temporary visas as students, exchange visitors or in other nonimmigrant classifications.</p> <p>The CSU uses separate requirements and application filing dates in the admission of foreign students. Verification of English proficiency (see the section on the English Language Requirement for undergraduate applicants), financial resources, and academic performance are each important considerations for admission. Academic records from foreign institutions must be on file at least ten weeks prior to the beginning of the term applied for and, if not in English, must be accompanied by certified English translations.</p> <p>The university's strong curricular orientation toward performance and production well suits the academic needs of not only California but also other nations. For that reason, for decades Cal Poly Pomona has been committed to making an important contribution in the field of international education. Qualified students from all countries are encouraged to apply for admission and should use the following regulations as guidelines.</p> 
                  <ol start="1"> 
                   <li>All applicants must meet admission standards for English language proficiency. Please see section on TOEFL requirement.</li> 
                   <li>Cal Poly Pomona requires that original or certified copies of all original academic documents from non-U.S. institutions be submitted. The required documents include the complete official academic record (showing all course titles, dates taken and grades received), and academic diplomas or certificates awarded. These documents must be in the original language of issue. Official English translations must be provided as well as the official academic credentials in the original language. Applicants who have attended any U.S. institutions must request that official transcripts be sent directly from all of those institutions; certified copies of U.S. transcripts are not acceptable. Applicants to Master's or Credential programs must submit records from all post-secondary education. Applicants for undergraduate programs must submit records from all secondary and post-secondary education.</li> 
                   <li>International students who were granted F or J visas on the basis of their admission to another college or university are expected to complete at least one term at that institution. Visa students who are transferring from another U.S. college or university will not be considered for admission unless they have earned at least a 2.5 GPA.</li> 
                   <li>Permission to transfer from one school to another must be obtained in accordance with the regulations of the United States Immigration Service.</li> 
                   <li>The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service requires undergraduate F or J visa students to carry a minimum study load of 12 semester units. Visa students in graduate programs must carry not less than 8 units. International students are required by immigration regulations to be making satisfactory progress towards their educational objective.</li> 
                   <li>All F or J visa students are required to carry health insurance.</li> 
                  </ol> <p>Prospective students who wish further visa immigration information should contact the International Student Advisor in the International Center. Prospective international students should direct admission inquiries to the International Admissions Counselor in the Office of Admissions.</p> <h2><a id="Insurance_Requirement" name="Insurance_Requirement"></a>Insurance Requirement</h2> <p>Effective August 1, 1995, as a condition of receiving an I-20 or IAP-66 form, all F-1 and J-1 visa applicants must agree to obtain and maintain health insurance as a condition of registration and continued enrollment in the California State University. It is a requirement of enrollment at Cal Poly Pomona that all F-1 and J-1 visa holders purchase the approved campus health insurance policy. Effective fall quarter 1999, international students on F-1 or J-1 visas will be automatically billed through the Cashier's Office for yearlong health insurance coverage. Students are billed once each academic year for insurance, from the first term of enrollment to the end of the summer session. The annual premium is around $650.</p> <p>Cal Poly Pomona does not have provisions for students to waive out of the insurance program. There is no exception to this rule. Further information may be obtained from the International Center, Building 1, Room 104.</p> <h2><a id="High_School_Students" name="High_School_Students"></a>High School Students</h2> <p>High school students may be considered for enrollment in certain special programs if recommended by the principal and the appropriate campus department chair and if preparation is equivalent to that required of eligible California high school graduates. Such admission is only for a given specific program and does not constitute a right to continued enrollment.</p> <h2><a id="Adult_Students" name="Adult_Students">Adult Students</a></h2> <p>As an alternative to regular admission criteria, an applicant who is twenty-five years of age or older may be considered for admission as an adult student if he or she meet all of the following conditions:</p> 
                  <ol start="1"> 
                   <li>Possesses a high school diploma (or has established equivalence through either the General Education Development or California High School Proficiency Examinations).</li> 
                   <li>Has not been enrolled in college as a full-time student for more than one term during the past five years.</li> 
                   <li>If there has been any college attendance in the past five years, has earned a 2.00 GPA or better in all college work attempted.</li> 
                  </ol> <p>Consideration will be based upon a judgment as to whether the applicant is as likely to succeed as a regularly admitted freshman or transfer student and will include an assessment of basic skills in the English language and mathematical computation.</p> <h2><a id="Reapplication_After_Failure_to_Enroll" name="Reapplication_After_Failure_to_Enroll">Reapplication After Failure to Enroll</a></h2> <p>Applicants who fail to register for the term for which they have been accepted will have their admission eligibility canceled. A new application, application fee, and enrollment deposit (if admitted) must then be filed, and admission requirements and deadlines existing for the term of the new application must be met.</p> <p>All transcripts on file for students who apply but do not attend are kept for two years if the student so requests. These transcripts may be used for admission during that period. However, transcripts of any additional work completed since the original transcripts were filed must be requested by the applicant from the college(s) attended, as part of the new application procedure.</p> <h2><a id="Returning_Students" name="Returning_Students"></a>Returning Students</h2> <p>Students who have been absent without prior approval for more than one term must apply for readmission. An application fee is charged before re-entry in such cases. An application with fee also must be filed by any student who enrolls elsewhere during an absence, with the following exceptions: (1) a summer session or extension program; (2) dual registration, with prior approval; (3) concurrent or visitor enrollment in another California State University. A student who was disqualified following the last term of attendance and has not been enrolled for more than two terms must file an application for re-admission as a returning disqualified student. If a student is returning to Cal Poly Pomona, after having attended another college/university, all traditional transfer admission requirements must be met (including supplemental requirements for impacted majors).</p> <p>Immigration regulations for international students who have been absent without prior approval supersede Cal Poly Pomona policy. International students should consult with an International Student Advisor.</p> <p>Returning students who have previously been enrolled at Cal Poly Pomona but have not been enrolled for five years or more will be required to submit new transcripts from all previous institutions attended in order to be re-admitted. Transcripts from previous institutions attended which are submitted for admissions purposes will not be maintained beyond five years after a student ceases to be enrolled at this institution.</p> <h2><a id="Returning_Veterans_Military_or_Alternative_Service" name="Returning_Veterans_Military_or_Alternative_Service">Returning Veterans (Military or Alternative Service)</a></h2> <p>Students at Cal Poly Pomona entering active U.S. military service or approved alternative service are eligible for continuing student status following active service. Time served in active military or approved alternative service, including the entire term in which the student entered the service and the entire term in which he or she was discharged, will not be counted as a break in attendance in determining continuing student status.</p> <h2><a id="Transfer_Within_State_Universities_or_Colleges" name="Transfer_Within_State_Universities_or_Colleges"></a>Transfer Within State Universities or Colleges</h2> <p>Students enrolled in a California State University are eligible for admission at any other institution in the system, provided they are in good standing. Students on probation at their resident campus may apply for admission as transfer students to another campus in the system, subject to that institution's policy and space availability. A complete application is required, including fee, all official transcripts, and test score reports.</p> <h3>Visitors Within CSU</h3> <p>Matriculated students in good standing enrolled at one CSU campus may enroll at another CSU campus for one term. Credit earned at the host campus is reported at the student's request to the home campus to be included on the student's transcript at the home campus. Visitor transfers are approved for one term only and are subject to space availability and enrollment priority policies at the host campus. Enrollment as visitor transfers may be repeated after re-enrollment at the home campus. This opportunity may be particularly valuable to students whose educational progress can be enhanced by attending a full summer session at Cal Poly Pomona. Concurrent enrollment (see above) is not permitted during visitor status. Current Cal Poly Pomona students wishing to transfer temporarily to another CSU campus should obtain the appropriate form from the Registrar's Office. Visitor forms are to be approved at the home campus.</p> <h3>Concurrent Enrollment Within CSU</h3> <p>Students enrolled in any California State University may enroll concurrently at another CSU campus if they have completed 12 units at the home campus with a 2.0 grade point average and are in good standing. Concurrent enrollment is approved for a specific term, subject to space availability and registration priority policies at the host campus. Because of overlap in academic terms of campuses on term and quarter calendars, concurrent enrollment is subject to combinations and conditions described in the concurrent enrollment application forms available from the Registrar's Office, (909) 869-3000. Concurrent enrollment applications are to be approved at the home campus.</p> <p>International students on visas should consult with the International Student Advisor in the International Center before finalizing plans.</p> <h3>CSU Fully Online</h3> <p>Full-time students enrolled at Cal Poly Pomona have access to fully articulated online courses at other term CSU campuses through Online Concurrent Enrollment (CSU fully online).&nbsp; This access is offered without students being required to be admitted formally to the other CSU campus, and sometimes without paying additional fees.&nbsp; Students should consult with their academic advisor to determine how such a course may apply to their degree program, prior to enrolling at another CSU campus.&nbsp; More information is available through the Registrar's Office website: <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/~registrar/registration/Concurrent-Enrollment.shtml">https://www.cpp.edu/~registrar/registration/Concurrent-Enrollment.shtml</a>.</p> <h3>Cross Enrollment at University of California or California Community Colleges</h3> <p>Undergraduate students enrolled in the California State University may enroll, without formal admission and without payment of additional State University Fees, in a maximum of one course per academic term at a campus of either of the other systems on a space available basis and at the discretion of the appropriate campus authorities on both campuses. Enrollment in pre-collegiate courses is excluded.</p> <p>A student is qualified to cross enroll if the student has met all of the following requirements.</p> 
                  <ol start="1"> 
                   <li>completed at least one term at the home campus as a matriculated student,</li>

These regulations were promulgated not to determine whether a student is a resident or nonresident of California, but rather to determine whether a student qualifies to pay university fees at the in-state or out-of-state rate. A resident for tuition purposes is someone who meets the requirements set forth in the Uniform Student Residency Requirements. These laws governing residency for tuition purposes at the California State University are California Education Code sections 68000-68086, 68120- 68133, and 89705-89707.5, and California Code of Regulations, Title 5, Subchapter 5, Article 4, sections 41900- 41915. This material can be viewed by accessing the California State University <a href="https://www2.calstate.edu/csu-system/administration/general-counsel">Office of General Counsel website</a>.<a href="http://www.calstate.edu/GC/resources.shtml"> </a></p> <p>Each campus's Admissions Office is responsible for determining the residency status of that campus's new and returning students based, as applicable, on the student's Application for Admission, Residency Questionnaire, and, as necessary, other information the student furnishes. A student who fails to provide sufficient information to establish resident status will be classified a nonresident.</p> <h3>Residency Requirements</h3> <h4>Initial Determination: Legal Capacity, Physical Presence and Intent</h4> <p>To be classified as a resident for tuition purposes, a student must show they have been a legal California resident for more than one year immediately prior to the Residence Determination Date for the term of the application is made. Depending on the age, immigration status or visa type, a student may not have the legal capacity to establish California residency.</p> <p>Generally, establishing California residency for tuition purposes requires a combination of physical presence and intent to remain indefinitely in the State of California. An adult who, at least 366 days prior to the residency determination date for the term in which resident status is sought, can demonstrate that both physical presence in the state combined with evidence of intent to remain in California indefinitely, may establish California residency for tuition purposes. A student under the age of 19 by the residency determination date derives residency from the parent(s) with whom the student resides or most recently resided. In addition, non-citizens establish residency in the same manner as citizens, unless precluded by the Immigration and Nationality Act from establishing domicile in the United States.</p> <p>Evidence demonstrating intent to remain in the State of California indefinitely may vary from case to case, but will include, and is not necessarily limited to, the absence of residential ties to any other state, California voter registration and history of actually voting in California elections, maintaining California vehicle registration and driver's license, maintaining active California bank accounts, filing California income tax returns and listing a California address on federal tax returns, owning residential property or occupying or renting a residence where permanent belongings are kept, maintaining active memberships in California professional or social organizations, and maintaining a permanent military address and home of record in California.</p> <h4>Exceptions</h4> <p>Exceptions to the general residency requirements are contained in California Education Code sections 68070-68086 and California Code of Regulations, Title 5, Subchapter 5, Article 4, sections 41906- 41906.6, 41910. Whether an exception applies to a particular student can only be determined after the submission of an application for admission and, as necessary, additional supporting documentation. Because neither the campus nor the Chancellor's Office staff may give legal advice, applicants are strongly urged to review the material for themselves and consult with a legal advisor.</p> <p>Residency determination dates are set each term.

                  </table> <h5>Nonresident Tuition Exemptions for Military Servicemembers, Veterans, and Dependents</h5> <h6>Background</h6> <p>Several state and federal laws provide exemptions from paying nonresident tuition for current and former members of the U.S. <em>Armed Forces</em> and their <em>dependents</em>. While these fee exemptions ensure students do not pay more than California residents, <u>they do not establish California residency or establish eligibility for state benefits that require residency</u>. Students receiving an exemption from nonresident tuition are encouraged, but in most cases not required, to take the necessary steps to establish California state residency. Eligibility for exemption from nonresident tuition is evaluated and established at the time of admission to a CSU campus. If a student has a break in enrollment requiring an application for readmission, residency status and eligibility for the nonresident tuition exemption will be reevaluated based on facts presented at the time of reapplication. To meet this exemption, the student must reside in California. However, they are not required to meet physical presence by the Residence Determination Date, intent, or financial independence residency requirements. The student is responsible for submitting supporting documents by the last day of the term. Any documents received after the last day of the term will be processed for the following term.</p> <h6>Servicemembers</h6> <p>A member of the <em>Armed Forces of the United States</em> who is stationed in the state shall be exempt from paying nonresident tuition. (<strong>Note</strong>: California Education Code provides an expanded definition of "member of the <em>Armed Forces of the United States</em>" for this section (see footnote 2).</p> <p>California law does not provide a nonresident tuition fee exemption to <em>servicemembers </em>on temporary military orders to attend a state-supported institution of higher education.</p> <p>The following documents must be submitted to show evidence of eligibility:</p> 
                  <ul> 
                   <li>A statement from the student's commanding officer or personnel officer stating that the assignment to <em>active duty</em> in this State is not for educational purposes, and</li> 
                   <li>Military orders, a letter from the unit commander or personnel staff, or other military service personnel documents showing the date of assignment to California, and</li> 
                   <li>A copy of the servicemember's orders indicating his/her assignment to California is a Permanent Change of Station (PCS).</li> 
                  </ul> <p>Exemption from paying nonresident tuition continues for as long as the student is continuously enrolled at the same institution. The exemption continues even if the <em>servicemember </em>retires or is transferred to a different state for military duty.</p> <h6>Dependents of Servicemembers</h6> <p>A dependent of an active duty servicemember who meets either of the following criteria shall be exempt from paying nonresident tuition.</p> <p>The servicemember is on active duty and stationed in California.</p> <p>Documents required</p>

Students can enroll in these courses without entering military service or incurring a service obligation. At the point a cadet becomes a member of the armed forces, he or she becomes qualified for a nonresident tuition exemption. See rules for <strong>Servicemembers </strong>above. Documents used to show membership in the armed forces may include a Department of Defense ID card and/or an enlistment contract or orders.</p> <p>NOTE: Membership in or a contract for the Delayed Entry Program is not acceptable as the student has not yet entered into the service.</p> <h6>Military Definitions</h6> <p><em>Active Duty</em> - full-time duty in the <em>Armed Forces</em>, other than <em>active duty</em> <em>for training</em>.

A student seeking reclassification is required to complete a Residency Questionnaire that includes questions concerning financial independence. For additional information on intent, physical presence and financial independence requirements, refer to the <a href="https://www2.calstate.edu/apply/california-residency-for-tuition-purposes">California Residency for Tuition Purposes website</a>.</p> <h4>Residency Appeals</h4> <p>A student classified as a nonresident may appeal a final campus decision within 30 days of notification by the campus. Appeals will be accepted only if at least one of the following criteria applies:</p> <p>1. The decisions was based on:</p> <p style="margin-left:40px">a. significant error of fact by the campus;</p> <p style="margin-left:40px">b. a significant procedural error by the campus; or</p> <p style="margin-left:40px">c. an innocent application of the law which, if corrected would require that the student be reclassified as a California resident; and/or</p> <p>2. Significant new information, not previously known or available to the student, became available after the date of the campus decision classifying the student as a nonresident and based on the new information, the classification as a nonresident is incorrect.</p> <p>Instructions to submit an appeal and additional information can be found on the <a href="https://www2.calstate.edu/apply/california-residency-for-tuition-purposes">California Residency for Tuition Purposes website.</a></p> <p>Appeals via email, fax and U.S. mail will not be accepted. A student with a documented disability who is requesting an accommodation to submit an appeal through the <a href="http://www.calstate.edu/">CSU website</a> should contact Student Affairs and Enrollment Management at <a href="mailto:residencyappeals@calstate.edu">residencyappeals@calstate.edu</a><strong>.</strong></p> <p>The Chancellor's Office will either decide the appeal or send the matter back to the campus for further review.</p> <p>A student incorrectly classified as a resident or incorrectly granted an exception from nonresident tuition is subject to reclassification as a nonresident or withdrawal of the exception and subject to payment of nonresident tuition in arrears. If incorrect classification results from false or concealed facts, the student may also be subject to discipline pursuant to Section 41301 of Title 5 of the California Code of Regulations. A student previously classified as a resident or previously granted an exception is required to immediately notify the Admissions Office if the student has reason to believe that the student no longer qualifies as a resident or no longer meets the criteria for an exception.</p> <p>Changes may have been made in the rate of nonresident tuition and in the statutes and regulations governing residency for tuition purposes in California between the time this information is published and the relevant residency determination date. Students are urged to review the statutes and regulations stated above.</p> <h2><a id="First_Year_Student_Residential_Requiremet" name="First_Year_Student_Residential_Requiremet"></a>First-Year Student Residential Requirement</h2> <p>Cal Poly Pomona requires all first-time freshmen who graduated from high schools outside the local area to live in University Housing during their first year on a space available basis. Exemptions from the residential requirement will be considered upon meeting specific criteria. Please refer to the University Housing website at&nbsp;<a href="https://cpp.edu/~housing/">https://cpp.edu/~housing/</a> for more details.</p> <h2><a id="Use_of_Social_Security_Number" name="Use_of_Social_Security_Number">Use of Social Security Number</a></h2> <p>Applicants are required to include their correct social security numbers in designated places on applications for admission pursuant to the authority contained in Section 41201, Title 5, California Code of Regulations, and Section 6109 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 6109). The university uses the social security number to identify students and their records including identification for purposes of financial aid eligibility and disbursement and the repayment of financial aid and other debts payable to the institution. Also, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires the university to file information returns that include the student's social security number and other information such as the amount paid for qualified tuition, related expenses and interest on educational loans. This information is used by the IRS to help determine whether a student, or a person claiming a student as a dependent, may take a credit or deduction to reduce federal income taxes.</p> <p>Applicants who do not have a U.S. social security number should leave the space blank on the application form. The Office of Admissions will allocate a student ID number for admission and enrollment purposes.

If a student has received Advanced Placement credit for a course, IB credit will not be given for the same course.</p> <p><a href="/mime/media/57/3802/International+Baccalaureate+%28IB%29+Examination+Credit_2021-22_v4.pdf">2021-2022 IB Examination Credit</a><span style="display: none !important">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p> <h3><a id="CLEP_Examinations" name="CLEP_Examinations"></a>CLEP Examinations</h3> <p>California State Polytechnic University, Pomona grants credit to those students who pass examinations that have been approved for credit systemwide. This information is subject to change. Contact the Office of Academic Programs, Building 121, for further information.</p> <p><a href="/mime/media/57/3803/College-Level+Examination+Program+%28CLEP%29+Credit_2021-22_v3.pdf">2021-2022 CLEP</a><span style="display: none !important">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p> <h3>Credit by Challenge Examination</h3> <p>Students may challenge courses by taking examinations developed at Cal Poly Pomona. Only enrolled undergraduate students may challenge courses. Credit shall be awarded to those who pass them successfully. A student may not challenge more than 24 semester units worth of coursework.</p> <p>An approved Credit by Examination form permits regularly enrolled students to obtain university credit for subject matter in which they are especially qualified through nontraditional education or experience. Students must not have previously received credit for any course containing similar or advanced material from the same subject matter field. Students are not permitted to obtain credit by examination unless all prerequisites for the course as specified in the University Catalog have been satisfied. Credit by examination will not be allowed for a course that is a prerequisite of a course which the student has already completed or in which the student is currently enrolled.</p> <p>Challenge exams shall not be permitted as a means of earning a higher grade in a course. Once a student has enrolled in and earned a grade (passing or failing) in a course, the only way to earn a higher grade is to repeat the course and pay regular course unit fees. A course may be challenged only once.</p> <p>No student, including resident, out of state, or foreign, shall be permitted by an instructor to sit in a class without enrolling either for audit or credit, and paying appropriate fees. Challenge exam credit will not be given for any course that has been audited. Units of credit received through this procedure may not apply toward the residence requirement for any of the degrees or credentials offered by the university.</p> <p>The Credit by Challenge Examination option can only be utilized if the student is enrolled in other coursework in the requested term.&nbsp; If they take the exam and pass, the students will incur the fees associated with the units earned for that course.&nbsp; A $5 fee per unit is charged for each challenge examination ($25 maximum). In addition, resident students who are paying less than full time should be alerted that they will be charged the difference if they pass the examination and grades are posted.&nbsp; Non-resident students who pass and have a grade posted are expected to pay for the non-resident units.&nbsp; Visit the Tuition and Fees site to learn more about the tuition and fee structure by units enrolled.</p> <p>The length of the examination will be consistent with the unit value of the course. It may include written, oral, or skills tests, or a combination of all three types and will be sufficiently comprehensive to determine that the student has essentially the same knowledge and skills as those students who successfully complete the course are required to possess. Challenge examination credit is entered on the student's permanent record. For courses in the student's major, the credit is a letter grade. Other challenge exam credit is awarded on a CR/NC basis.</p> <p>Detailed instructions for applying for credit by examination may be obtained from the Registrar's Office.</p> <h3>Credit for Non-Collegiate Instruction</h3> <p>California State Polytechnic University, Pomona grants undergraduate degree credit for successful completion of noncollegiate instruction, either military or civilian, appropriate to the baccalaureate degree, which has been recommended by the Commission on Educational Credit and Credentials of the American Council on Education (ACE). The number of units allowed are those recommended in the Guide to the Evaluation of Educational Experience in the Armed Services and the National Guide to Educational Credit for Training Programs.</p> <h2><a name="Credit_for_Military_Service"></a>Credit for Military Service</h2> <p>Six (6) semester units of elective credit will be allowed toward a baccalaureate degree for a student with an other than dishonorable discharge from the military services of the United States who submits evidence of satisfactory completion of at least one year of active military service. Three of the six units will be applied toward General Education Area E upon successful completion of <a href="preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=57&amp;coid=263869" onclick="acalogPopup('preview_course.php?catoid=57&amp;coid=263869&amp;print', '3', 770, 530, 'yes');return false;" rel="remote /ajax/preview_course.php?catoid=57&amp;coid=263869&amp;display_options[location]=tooltip&amp;show" id="tt597" target="_blank">ENG 1103</a><span style="display: none !important">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;or <a href="preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=57&amp;coid=263868" onclick="acalogPopup('preview_course.php?catoid=57&amp;coid=263868&amp;print', '3', 770, 530, 'yes');return false;" rel="remote /ajax/preview_course.php?catoid=57&amp;coid=263868&amp;display_options[location]=tooltip&amp;show" id="tt6128" target="_blank">ENG 1101</a><span style="display: none !important">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;(or the equivalent).</p> <p>An additional 9 semester units of elective credit will be allowed toward graduation to any student submitting evidence of receiving a commission in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, or Marine Corps. Credit is not given for completion of the six-month reserve training programs or for college level general educational development tests.</p> <p>Credit for specific courses may be allowed if the student has satisfactorily completed equivalent study in a military service school. The guidelines of the American Council on Education are followed in determining eligibility and approval must be granted by the department teaching the specific course for which credit is sought.</p> <p>DANTES Subject Standardized Test (DANTES/DSST) credit is awarded based on American Council on Education recommendations.</p> <p>More information regarding transfer credit awarded for military coursework may be found here: <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/registrar//transfer-credit-info/index.shtml">https://www.cpp.edu/registrar//transfer-credit-info/index.shtml</a>.</p> <h2><a name="Credit_for_Continuing_Education_Course_Work"></a>Credit for Continuing Education Course Work</h2> <p>Students taking more than 24 college level transferable semester units through Cal Poly Pomona or other Continuing Education or Extended Education programs or Open University course work may satisfy a specific course requirement, but only 24 units may be considered by the University as transferable college level work which meets the minimum number of semester units required for a degree.</p> <h2><a name="Curriculum_Deviation"></a>Curriculum Deviation</h2> <p>Although the university has specified a program of courses for each major, under certain conditions a student may be permitted to deviate from the established curriculum via a petition process. Information regarding requests to deviate from the curriculum may be obtained from the student's adviser.</p> <h2><a id="full-time_equivalent" name="full-time_equivalent"></a>Full-Time Equivalent</h2> <p>Enrollment in the California State University is measured in full-time equivalent (FTE) students. One FTE is the equivalent of 15 semester units of student course credit taken by one or more students. One FTE could represent one student carrying 15 course-units, three students each carrying five course-units, five students each carrying three course-units, or any other student/course-unit combinations the product of which equals 15 course-units. The university's FTE enrollment is the total course-units taken by all students divided by 15.</p> <h2><a id="full_time_student" name="full_time_student"></a>Full-Time Student</h2> <p>An undergraduate student is considered full-time for such purposes as veterans' benefits, social security benefits, athletic eligibility and other financial aids when enrolled for 12 semester units. A full-time student is not necessarily a full-time equivalent (FTE) student.</p> <p>Graduate students and some, but not all, categories of postbaccalaureate students are considered full-time for many purposes when they are enrolled for 6 semester units.</p> <h2><a name="Leave_of_Absence__Planned_Educational_Leave_"></a>Leave of Absence (Planned Educational Leave)</h2> <p>When a student finds it necessary to interrupt progress toward a degree for a reason related to the educational objective and acceptable to the appropriate university authorities, the student may be granted a leave of absence (LOA). A student on leave of absence may, upon return from the leave, continue in the same program that the student had prior to the leave, and the student retains the right to elect requirements in effect at the time of returning into the curriculum.</p> <p>To be eligible for LOA, a student must:</p> 
                  <ul> 
                   <li>State the reason for requesting a LOA</li> 
                   <li>Experience an unforeseeable and unexpected circumstance that leads to a significant change such as medical reasons including pregnancy, major surgery, or other health-related circumstances; or have a professional or academic opportunities, such as travel or study abroad, employment related to educational goals and major fields of study, or participation in field study or research projects; or financial reasons, such as the necessity to work for a specified period in order to resume study with adequate resources</li> 
                   <li>Expect to return from LOA for a subsequent term that falls within the timeframe specified below</li> 
                   <li>Be in good academic standing</li> 
                   <li>Consult with advisor and department prior to completing the LOA</li> 
                   <li>Consult with financial aid advisor for implications</li> 
                   <li>Clear any financial account hold, if applicable</li> 
                   <li>Be cleared of any disciplinary action, if applicable&nbsp;</li> 
                  </ul> <p>A leave of absence may be granted when the student has filed a Leave of Absence petition with the Registrar's Office. The leave petition, which must be approved by the department chair, or graduate coordinator and school dean, shall specify the reasons for the leave and the duration of the leave. A student granted a LOA has a commitment from the university to be reinstated in good standing. This commitment must be validated by a written notice of return from leave for the term of return specified in the leave application submitted to the Registrar's Office prior to the start of the requested term for the students to be eligible to register without reapplying for admission to the University.</p> <p>It is the student's responsibility to demonstrate the significant relationship between the leave of absence and the progress toward the educational objective. LOA may be granted for a maximum of two calendar years or four consecutive terms. A request for leave of absence must be filed prior to the period of absence, before the first day of the requested term. Retroactive leave requests will not be approved.</p> <p><strong>Returning from Leave of Absence:</strong> A student must return to the expected term from leave of absence. Failure to return from leave as specified in the approved petition will be considered withdrawal from the university. Under such circumstances, re-enrollment will require a full application for readmission under the same circumstances as any new or returning applicant including enrollment in the curriculum in effect at the time of re-enrollment.</p> <p>Students may "stop-out" without filing for a leave of absence if the absence does not exceed one term.</p> <p>International students are reminded that immigration laws governing their visas do not allow them to take advantage of the "stop-out" university policy. International students should always consult with the International Student Advisor before attempting any leave of absence.</p> <h2><a id="military_leave_of_absence" name="military_leave_of_absence"></a>Military Leave of Absence</h2> <p>The Military Leave of Absence (MLOA) is granted to service members and veterans who are called to active duty.&nbsp; The cumulative length of all absences for service in the Armed Forces may not exceed five years of time spent performing actual service.&nbsp; This period does not include the period before reporting for duty and the time between completing service and returning to the institution.&nbsp; A student who is injured or becomes ill as a consequence of military service must submit their intent to re-enroll no later than two years after the end of the period that is necessary for recovery from such illness or injury.&nbsp;</p> <p>Affected individuals include the following:</p> 
                  <ul> 
                   <li>Active duty military personnel serving during a war, military operation, state or national emergency.</li> 
                   <li>Members of the National Guard performing a qualifying duty (e.g. called to active service by the Governor, President, Secretary of Defense for a period of more than 30 consecutive days) during a war, military operation, state or national emergency.</li> 
                   <li>Service members who suffer economic hardship as a result of a war, military operation, state or national emergency.</li> 
                  </ul> <p>A student who is called to active military duty at any point during the term including less than 30 consecutive days should promptly notify the Registrar's Office in writing via the Leave of Absence request form and submit the military orders with departure date. If military orders are classified and cannot be shared, a letter from the commanding officer regarding the date of deployment and confidentiality status will be accepted.&nbsp;MLOA does not count against program time to completion; however, repayment of Federal Financial Aid may be required after 180 days have expired. MLOA is available to a student who is deployed regardless of the student's academic standing.</p> <p>If the student withdraws from current courses on or before week 10 of the term, the student will receive a full refund of tuition and fees, and be removed from all courses in progress, thereby removing them from the student's record. If the student withdraws from current courses on or after week 11 of the term, the student will receive full credit with grades earned at the time of MLOA. If a course relies on a final project and/or examination to determine satisfactory performance, no credit will be granted until all required work is completed. A student taking online courses may continue to be enrolled in those courses, if possible. A student wanting to complete their courses via independent study may do so with the consent of the instructor of record for the course(s).</p> <p><strong>ADDITIONAL READMISSION GUIDANCE</strong></p> <p>Students must be readmitted to the same academic program, with the same academic standing, that they were in at the time the absence began. "Prompt readmission" means that students must be offered readmission into the next class or classes in their program after they provide notice of their intent to re-enroll.</p> <p>For the first academic year after readmission, students who are readmitted under these provisions must be charged the same tuition and fees that would have been assessed for the academic year during which the student left the institution. This is not required if the student's veterans' education benefits, such as the G.I. Bill, will cover the full amount of current tuition and fees.</p> <p>If the campus determines that the student is not prepared to resume the program with the same academic status, the institution must make reasonable efforts at no extra cost to the student to help the student become prepared to complete the program.</p> <p>Eligibility for readmission under the terms of the HEOA terminates upon any of the following events:</p> 
                  <ul> 
                   <li>Being separated from the Armed Forces with a dishonorable discharge.</li> 
                   <li>Being dismissed as permitted under section 1161(a) of title 10, United States Code.</li> 
                   <li>Being dropped from the rolls pursuant to section 1161(b) of title 10, United States Code.</li> 
                  </ul> <p>A service member or veteran who does not meet the Code of Federal Regulations 34, section 688.18 criteria does not give up their right to readmission, but may be subject to the institution's established leave of absence policy and general practices</p> <p>Refer to the CSU policy on detail information for <a href="https://calstate.policystat.com/policy/6654882/latest/">MLOA and Readmission Guidance</a> for service members.</p> <h3>Accomodations of Military Student Service Obligations (Less than 30 Days)</h3> <p>Students called to fulfill military service obligations of less than 30 days and who are currently enrolled in courses should be given every opportunity to successfully complete coursework. Alternate exam dates, assignment dates, and an opportunity to complete outstanding work is required. Military service is considered an excused absence and students may not be penalized for missing class, assignments, or exams, while fulfilling military service obligations.</p> <p>The University recognizes that professional guidelines, ethics, and requirements could mean that even a short absence would leave a student at a significant disadvantage in some programs, courses, labs, or projects.</p> <p>The University short-term Military Service Obligations Policy (Less than 30 days) includes the following:</p> 
                  <ol start="1"> 
                   <li>Regarding timelines and procedures for completing work missed at different points in the semester.

                     <li>The student will be allowed to work with the Department Chair and/or Associate Dean to complete any outstanding coursework in cases in which the instructor of record cannot do so (For example, an adjunct, retiree, or faculty member out on leave, is no longer available)</li> 
                     <li>A student will be allowed to receive an Incomplete Authorized "I" grade. An Incomplete Contract must be created by the instructor of record and accepted by the student.</li> 
                     <li>A reasonable extension will be granted to a student for any outstanding or incomplete coursework.</li> 
                    </ol> </li> 
                   <li>If required to complete coursework, a student will be given access to specific and secure facilities or provided reasonable alternatives.</li> 
                   <li>If required to complete internship requirements, a student will be provided with specific instructions and reasonable alternatives.</li> 
                   <li>If a student is called to service more than once or for a significant period of the semester, the department will indicate if it is feasible for the student to complete the courses. Departments may indicate that some courses must be completed in person for valid reasons, such as accreditation requirements, licensure requirements, supervisory requirements, and so forth. 
                    <ol start="1" style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"> 
                     <li>In such cases, a student will be given the option of withdrawal with a WX instead of Incomplete ("I") or Withdrawal Unauthorized ("WU").</li> 
                    </ol> </li> 
                   <li>Student will be made aware of any potential repercussions of withdrawal or grades of Incomplete in regards to financial aid and VA Educational Benefits. (For example, Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) Standards for Financial Aid Applicants - withdrawing from a course, including receiving a WX, or receiving a grade of Incomplete may have a negative impact on the student's SAP status and financial aid eligibility). Impacted student should be directed to contact Cal Poly Pomona's Veterans Resource Center to determine how recommendations may impact a student's financial aid eligibility, and/or VA educational benefits. This will ensure that a student's circumstances are well assessed before any recommendation is communicated to the student.</li> 
                   <li>A student should contact the Veterans Resource Center for assistance in navigating the military leave of absence process.</li>

Registration appointments for eligible continuing students are available online via BroncoDirect prior to the start of the registration period. All registration holds must be cleared prior to registration. New undergraduate students will register for classes as part of their participation in mandatory orientation. During orientation, new undergraduate students may register for a maximum of 16 semester units.</p> <h2><a name="Maximum_Unit_Load"></a>Maximum Unit Load</h2> <p>Students register online through <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/broncodirect/">BroncoDirect</a>. Undergraduate students may register for up to 15 semester units for Priority Registration. During the General Registration period for fall and spring, students may register for up to 16 semester units.&nbsp; Graduating seniors may register for up to 18 semester units beginning with general registration. During the Add/Drop period, students may register for up to 18 semester units. For summer General and Add/Drop Registration periods, students may register for up to 12 semester units only.&nbsp;</p> <p>Graduate students are subject to the same maximum units as the undergraduate students as referenced above. The normal course load for graduate students is 6 semester units.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>During the Add/Drop period, a student may seek approval to add units beyond the unit cap by getting approval on the Petition to Exceed Unit Cap form available on the Registrar's Office webpage.</p> <p>Credit for a course is given only when the student has completed the registration process and successfully completes the course. Specific registration and fee payment dates and instructions are available online at <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/~registrar/">https://www.cpp.edu/~registrar/</a>. Deadlines are strictly enforced.&nbsp; For information regarding registration tuition and fees, please refer to the Student Accounting and Cashiering Services.</p> <h2><a id="general_registration" name="general_registration">General Registration</a></h2> <p>Students are assigned registration appointments for each registration period. Students who have been awarded priority by the Academic Senate are assigned appointments prior to the beginning of this registration period. Registration appointments for postbaccalaureate students normally begin on the first day of registration. Undergraduates are assigned appointments based on the number of units earned and applicable toward the CPP degree.</p> <h2><a id="priority_registration" name="priority_registration"></a>Priority Registration</h2> <p>Priority Registration is the initial first two days at the beginning of the registration period. &nbsp;It is granted to student groups approved by the Academic Senate each term.&nbsp; Certain student groups receive priority registration based on mandated policy governed by federal and state regulations (e.g. military veterans, disability, foster youth, EOP, etc.).&nbsp;</p> <h2><a name="Adding_or_Dropping_Courses"></a>Adding or Dropping Classes</h2> <p>Registered students who do not attend in class the first ten (10) instructional days of the term may be dropped from the class roster by the instructor. However, the responsibility for properly dropping classes ultimately rests with each student. Students who do not drop a registered class which they are not attending are subject to receiving a failing grade.</p> <p>Classes may be added or sections changed through the last day of the Add/Drop period via BroncoDirect Student Center. Students may drop a class without record through the last day of Add/Drop; these dropped course(s) will not appear on the student's permanent record. After the fourth week of instruction, students may petition to drop a class only for serious and compelling reasons. Permission to drop during this time period will be granted only with the approval of the faculty and the student's major department chair and college dean. A statement of the reason(s) for dropping is required. For a class dropped during this period, a "W" grade will automatically be recorded. Students are permitted only 18 units of W grades in classes unless there are circumstances clearly beyond the student's control. All requests for permission to drop under these circumstances and all approvals will be made through a Registrar's Office petition process.</p> <p>Dropping of classes shall not be permitted during the final four weeks of instruction except in cases in which the reason is due to circumstances clearly beyond the student's control. Such drops may be approved for the following reasons: mental health concerns which requires professional consultation; serious illness or accident resulting in considerable loss of time; and/or financial difficulty or other personal problems of a serious nature which require withdrawal from the university or reduction in load (supporting documentation may be required). Failure in a class is not an acceptable reason for withdrawing. Ordinarily dropping of classes during this time period will involve total withdrawal from the university.</p> <p>If a student stops attending without a validated withdrawal petition on file in the Registrar's Office, the "W" grade will not appear on the final grade report. The administrative grade of "WU" or "F" will be assigned. For explanation of these grading symbols, see catalog section "<a href="https://catalog.cpp.edu/content.php?catoid=53&amp;navoid=4006#Grading_System__See_also__Graduate_Studies__section_">Grading System</a>." Students may improve their GPA, as a consequence of receiving a "WU" or "F", by formally repeating the course. See "<a href="https://www.cpp.edu/registrar/student-record/course-repetition.shtml">Repeated Course Policy</a>."</p> <h2><a name="Auditing_Courses"></a>Auditing Courses</h2> <p>Auditing a course is attending a class for no credit. A student must be registered and must have paid fees in order to audit a course. Audited courses must be included on the student's official program of study and they are designated by AU beside the course unit listing. The Course Auditing Form must be signed by the instructor and returned to the Registrar's Office by the end of week three of instruction. No exceptions to this policy are permitted.</p> <p>Courses may be added for audit only during the add period (first through fifth day). There is no preregistration to audit a course. Once a student has decided to audit a course or take a course for credit, the student cannot switch this status. The student's college dean must approve the decision for a student who has audited a class to subsequently repeat that course for credit.</p> <h3>Drops - Instructor Initiated</h3> <p>It is a student's responsibility to ensure that they have been dropped from a class by following the appropriate procedures within the given time period for each term. Students should attend the first class meeting available to them after they register for the class or drop the class if they do not plan to attend. If a student is absent without prior notification, the instructor of record (or department office) may then administratively drop the student from the class. Students are cautioned never to depend on this faculty option, but to take responsibility for appropriately dropping the class. A student may also be administratively dropped, if they do not meet the prerequisites of the course. These administrative drops shall be without penalty and initiated by the instructor using the online administrative drop process no later than the end of the tenth day of instruction.</p> <h2><a id="registration_and_related_holds" name="registration_and_related_holds"></a>Registration and Related Holds</h2> <p>Student records may be placed on a hold status due to obligations to the university. Having a hold status is denoted by a negative service indicator in Bronco Direct. Depending on the type of the hold, registration, grades, confirmation of graduation, issuing of diploma, and accounts receivable may be impacted until the hold is resolved. Students may view their registration-related holds online at&nbsp;<a href="https://broncodirect.cms.cpp.edu/">https://broncodirect.cms.cpp.edu</a>. It is the responsibility of the student to clear a registration hold, or service indicator, prior to attempting to register. Other types of holds will be noted in the student record file and it is the responsibility of the student to fulfill hold obligations with the department that issued the service indicator prior to receiving certain services within the university.</p> <h2>Limited Enrollment - Courses Open to Majors Only</h2> <p>Due to impaction in certain academic majors, enrollment in courses within these programs may be limited to approved majors or by department consent only. Certain exceptions are possible with written permission of the instructor and the department chair by an academic petition.</p> <h2><a id="student_profile" name="student_profile"></a>Student Profile</h2> <p>A student is responsible for maintaining their personal information, contact information, and emergency contact information current with Cal Poly Pomona.</p> <h3>Personal Information</h3> <p>CPP must protect the identity of a student and maintain the integrity of their record when changing their legal/primary name (as it appears on official document), social security number, birthday, or citizenship status.&nbsp; Changes to this information must be submitted using the Change of Information form and include two copies of government-issued documentation to the Registrar's Office.&nbsp; The following documents will support the request:</p>

It may also be disclosed as directory information unless the student declines to permit such disclosure. All official documents including but not limited to transcripts, payroll records, and financial aid documents will include a student's legal name.</p> <p>Student can typically use any preferred first or middle name. A preferred first and middle name must consist of alphabetical characters, hyphens, and spaces. Cal Poly Pomona reserves the right to deny or remove, with or without notice, a preferred first and middle name, if it is used for inappropriate purposes including but not limited to misrepresentation, avoiding legal obligation, offensive or derogatory language, or to perpetrate fraud. Inappropriate use of a preferred name may be a violation of the Student Code of Conduct and will be referred to the Dean of Students Office.</p> <p>CPP also offers students the option to specify their preferred pronouns, which will show up on class rosters for faculty.</p> <p>To submit a preferred first and middle name, or pronoun, view instructions through Student Center in BroncoDirect.</p> <h2><a id="ferpa" name="ferpa"></a>The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)</h2> <p>The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), also known as the Buckley Amendment (20 USC S. 1232g), affords eligible students certain rights with respect to their education records. An "eligible student" under FERPA is a student who is 18 years of age or older or who attends a postsecondary institution at any age. FERPA rights begin upon the student's enrollment, which occurs when the student has been admitted to the university and attends any portion of a course. FERPA does not apply to records of applicants for admissions. Standard university privacy policy may apply.</p> <p>For purposes of compliance with FERPA, CPP considers all students independent.&nbsp;Questions about FERPA and student records may be directed to the Registrar's Office</p> <h3>Education Records</h3> <p>A student record, also known as an education record, contains information directly related to a student whose record is personally identifiable. Personal identifiers that relate a student record include student name, student identification number, student address, parent/family member names, and a list of personal characteristics.&nbsp; Student education records are official and confidential documents. Education records include a range of information that is maintain in any recorded way such as handwriting, digital, paper, print, computer media, video or audio tape, film, microfilm, and microfiche. The education record includes but is not limited to:</p> 
                  <ul> 
                   <li>?Personal information such as a student's identification number, picture, or other information that would make it easy to identify or locate a student.</li> 
                   <li>Parent(s) and/or guardian contact information;</li> 
                   <li>Grades, test scores, courses taken, academic specializations and activities, and official letters regarding a student's status in school;</li> 
                   <li>Special education records;</li> 
                   <li>Disciplinary records;</li> 
                   <li>Documentation of attendance, schools attended, courses taken, awards conferred, and degrees earned.</li> 
                  </ul> <p>??Personal notes made by faculty members and other school officials not shared with others are not considered part of the education records. Admissions records will become part of a student's education record once the student attends courses in their first term. Educational records are maintained based on CPP records retention policies, stored in the Registrar's Office electronically and/or other in other forms of media with a secure backup file.</p> <h3>Student Rights</h3> <h4>Right to Inspect and Review</h4> <p>A&nbsp;student has the right to inspect and review the education record within forty-five (45) business days after&nbsp;the school receives a written request for access. A FERPA-Request to Review/Amend Education Records form must be submitted by&nbsp;the student&nbsp;to the Registrar's Office. The Registrar or designee&nbsp;will make arrangements for access and notify the student of next steps for inspecting the record. If the Registrar's Office does not retain the record requested, the student&nbsp;will be advised&nbsp;of the appropriate official to whom the request should be addressed.</p> <p>CPP will not issue a printed copy of the education record unless extenuating circumstances prevent its viewing in person. This determination will be made on a case-by-case basis.</p> <h4>Right to Request Amendments</h4> <p>A&nbsp;student has the right to request an amendment of the education record if the student believes the record is inaccurate or misleading. To request an amendment, a FERPA-Request to Review/Amend Education Records form must be submitted by the student to the Registrar's Office. The request must clearly identify the part of the record(s) to be&nbsp;changed, and specify why the record is inaccurate or misleading.</p> <h4>Right to Request a Hearing</h4> <p>The institution has the right to decide whether to amend a student's education record as requested by the student. If the school decides not to amend the record as requested by the student, the school will notify the student of the decision and advise the student of the right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. A student must submit a request for hearing in writing to the Registrar's Office. The Registrar will refer the&nbsp;request to the Vice President of Student Affairs, who will act as&nbsp;the hearing officer regarding all challenges to the&nbsp;accuracy of educational record and the denial of requested changes. The formal hearing will be conducted according to the following procedures:</p> 
                  <ul> 
                   <li>The student will be permitted to present information and materials in support of the assertion that the record is inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise erroneous.</li> 
                   <li>A representative of CPP will be permitted to present information and materials that support the school's position.</li> 
                   <li>Each party will be present during the hearing and may challenge information and materials of the other party.</li> 
                   <li>If a student is unable to attend the hearing in person due to distance (such as students participating in online programs), the student may be offered the opportunity to participate via a virtual platform (i.e. Zoom) or a phone conference.</li> 
                   <li>The hearing officer will render a decision on the matter generally within five (5) business days after the conclusion of the hearing. FERPA does not provide a process to be used to question substantive judgments, which are correctly recorded. For example, the rights of challenge do not allow a student to contest a grade in a course because the student believes a higher grade should have been assigned.</li> 
                  </ul> <h4>Right to Consent to Disclosures</h4> <p>A&nbsp;student has the right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in the education record, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. One exception that permits disclosure without consent is disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by the school in an administrative, supervisory, academic, research, or support staff position; a person or company with whom the school has contracted (such as an attorney, auditor, collection agent, or official of the U.S. Department of Education or other federal agency); a person serving on the Board of Trustees; or a student serving on an official committee or assisting another school official in performing tasks. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill professional responsibility.&nbsp; Student records will be disclosed to the CSU Chancellor's Office to conduct research, to analyze trends, or to provide other administrative services on behalf of the CSU.<br> <br> CPP <u>may</u> disclose education records in certain other circumstances:</p> 
                  <ul> 
                   <li>to comply with a judicial order or a lawfully issued subpoena</li> 
                   <li>to appropriate parties in a health or safety emergency</li> 
                   <li>to officials of another school, upon request, in which a student seeks or intends to enroll</li> 
                   <li>in connection with a student's request for or receipt of financial aid, as necessary to determine the eligibility, amount, or conditions of the financial aid, or to enforce the terms and conditions of the aid</li> 
                   <li>to certain officials of the U.S. Department of Education, the Comptroller General, to state and local educational authorities in connection with certain state or federally supported education programs</li> 
                   <li>to accrediting organizations to carry out their functions</li> 
                   <li>to parents of an eligible student if the student is a dependent for IRS tax purposes.</li> 
                   <li>to organizations conducting certain studies for or on behalf of CPP</li> 
                   <li>the results of an institutional disciplinary proceeding against the alleged perpetrator of a crime of violence may be released to the alleged victim of that crime with respect to that crime</li> 
                  </ul> <p>Additionally, CPP, upon written request, disclose to the alleged victim of any crime of violence or a non-forcible sex offense, the results of any disciplinary proceeding conducted by the school against a student who is the alleged perpetrator of such crime or offense.&nbsp;</p> <p>Alleged victims and perpetrators&nbsp;in sexual misconduct and sexual harassment incidents have a right to be informed of the outcome and sanctions of the hearing, in writing, without condition or limitation, and to be kept apprised of the status of investigations.</p> <p>If the alleged victim is deceased as a result of the crime or offense, the information shall be provided, upon written request, to the next of kin of the alleged victim.</p> <h4>Right to File a Complaint</h4> <p>A&nbsp;student has the right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by CPP to comply with the requirements of FERPA. The name and address of the office that administers FERPA is:</p> <p style="margin-left:1.5in">Family Policy Compliance Office,<br> U.S. Department of Education,<br> 400 Maryland Avenue, SW,<br> Washington, DC, 20202-5920.</p> <h4>Right to Restrict Directory Information</h4> <p>A&nbsp;student has the right to restrict the release of "directory information" except to school officials with legitimate educational interests and others as indicated above. To restrict the release of directory information, a student must submit the request in writing to the Registrar's Office. Once filed, this request becomes a permanent part of the student's record until the student instructs CPP in writing to remove the request.</p> <p>Cal Poly Pomona designates the following as public or "directory information":</p>

                   <li>To any&nbsp;other individual, if determined by the university to be in the best interest of the deceased or the university.</li> 
                  </ul> <p>After one year has lapsed following the death of a student or alumni, CPP may release the education&nbsp;record of the deceased at its discretion.&nbsp;</p> <h2><a id="retention_of_student_work" name="retention_of_student_work">Retention of Student Work</a></h2> <p>1.1 Student work refers to examinations and other materials, including materials in electronic form, which contribute to the student's final grade in a course and/or to the fulfillment of the requirements for a degree, program, or certification offered by the University. Duplicative copies in any format (such as digital or photographic copies) that preserve the content of the original work upon which grade evaluation is based are acceptable.</p> <p>1.2 Students have the right to examine their work even if the instructor chooses to retain it rather than return it. It is the student's responsibility to review their work within one academic term after a grade is assigned for the related course(s). If a student does not review their work within this time, the faculty has no further obligation to produce said work for student review. After one academic term, faculty members have the right to determine the method of disposal of the work. This disposal shall be in accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). For the purposes of this policy summer is not considered an academic term. If the instructor is on leave, on sabbatical, or is not currently on the faculty including those participating in the Faculty Early Retirement Program, the academic term in question is the term in which the faculty member returns.</p> <p>1.3 Student work pertaining to a grade appeal or other official review that is not completed must be retained until the appeal process is completed; provided the appeal process or other official review commenced within the academic term as defined in the subsection 1.2 of this policy.</p> <h2><a name="Cancellation_of_Registration_or_Withdrawal_from_Institution"></a>Cancellation of Registration or Withdrawal from the Institution</h2> <p>All students are expected to attend and participate in their course and maintain continuous enrollment for any academic term.&nbsp; Students who find it necessary to cancel their registration or to withdraw from all classes after enrolling for any academic term are required to follow the university's official withdrawal procedures. Failure to follow formal university procedures may result in an obligation to pay fees as well as the assignment of failing grades in all courses and the need to apply for readmission before being permitted to enroll in another academic term. Information on canceling registration and withdrawal procedures is available from the Registrar's Office, Building 121 (Student Services Building), 3rd floor. Students who withdraw from the term after the second week of classes will receive a "W" on their permanent records.</p> <p>Students who receive financial aid funds must consult with their financial advisor prior to withdrawing from the university regarding any required return or repayment of grant or loan assistance received for that academic term or payment period. Students who have received financial aid and withdraw from the institution during the academic term or payment period may need to return or repay some or all of the funds received, which may result in a debt owed to the institution.</p> <p>If a student is unable to withdraw from the university in person due to "serious and compelling" or "emergency" reasons and is unable to have a friend or relative obtain the necessary signatures, she/he should contact his/her respective academic department for assistance. Current documentation explaining the nature of the student's inability to come to campus to process the Withdrawal Petition, as well as documentation to support the serious and compelling or emergency situation, is required. Upon receiving such documentation, staff from the student's academic department will seek the appropriate signatures and, if approved, submit the Withdrawal Petition to the Registrar's Office.</p> <p>International students should consult with the International Student Advisor as to immigration regulations related to this university policy.</p> <h2><a name="Transfer_to_Other_Institutions"></a>Transfer to Other Institutions</h2> <p>A student who plans to transfer from this university to another college or university, should, at the earliest possible date, request that a transcript of record be forwarded by the Registrar's Office (see "<a href="https://www.cpp.edu/student-accounting/tuition-fees/index.shtml">Fees and Expenses Schedule</a>" for charges) to the new institution. Evaluation of transcripts will be made by the new institution.</p> <h2><a name="Privacy_Rights_of_Students_in_Education_Records"></a>Privacy Rights of Students in Education Records</h2> <p>The federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (20 U.S.C. 1232g) (FERPA) and regulations adopted thereunder (34 C.F.R. 99) set out requirements designed to protect students' privacy in their educational records maintained by the campus. The statute and regulations govern access to certain student records maintained by the campus and the release of those records. FERPA provides that the campus must give students access to most records directly related to the student, and must also provide opportunity for a hearing to correct the records if the student claims they are inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise inappropriate. The right to a hearing under this law does not include any right to challenge the appropriateness of a grade determined by the instructor. FERPA generally requires the campus obtain a student's written consent before releasing personally identifiable data pertaining to the student. The campus has adopted a set of policies and procedures governing implementation of FERPA and the regulations. Copies of these policies and procedures may be obtained from the Senior Associate Vice President of Enrollment Management and Services. Among the information included in the campus statement of policies and procedures is: (1) the student records maintained and the information they contain; (2) the campus official responsible for maintaining each record; (3) the location of access lists indicating persons requesting or receiving information from the record; (4) policies for reviewing and expunging records; (5) student access rights to their records; (6) procedure for challenging the content of student records; and (7) the student's right to file a complaint with the Department of Education. The Department of Education has established an office and review board to investigate complaints and adjudicate violations. The designated office is: Family Policy Compliance Office, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW, Washington, D.C. 20202-5920.</p> <p>FERPA authorizes the campus to release "directory information" pertaining to students. "Directory information" may include the student's name, address, telephone listing, electronic mail address, photograph, date and place of birth, major field of study, participation in officially recognized activities and sports, weight and height of members of athletic teams, dates of attendance, grade level, enrollment status, degrees, honors, and awards received, and the most recent previous educational agency or institution the student attended. The campus may release this "directory information" at any time unless the campus has received prior written objection from the student specifying the information the student requests not be released. Written objections must be sent to the Registrar's Office.</p> <p>The campus is authorized to provide access to student records to campus officials and employees who have legitimate educational interests in such access. These persons have responsibilities in the campus's academic, administrative or service functions and have reason for accessing student records associated with their campus or other related academic responsibilities. Student records will be disclosed to the CSU Chancellor's Office to conduct research, to analyze trends, or to provide other administrative services. Student records may also be disclosed to other persons or organizations under certain conditions (e.g., as part of the accreditation or program evaluation; in response to a court order or subpoena; in connection with financial aid; or to other institutions to which the student is transferring).</p> <h1><a id="Fees_and_Expenses" name="Fees_and_Expenses"></a>Fees and Expenses</h1> <h2><a id="schedule-of-tuition-and-fees-2020-21" name="schedule-of-tuition-and-fees-2020-21"></a>Schedule of Tuition and Fees, 2020-21</h2> <p>The CSU makes every effort to keep student costs to a minimum. Tuition and fees listed in published schedules or student accounts may need to be increased when public funding is inadequate.

                  </table> <p>The total nonresident tuition paid per term will be determined by the number of units taken.</p> <p>Mandatory systemwide tuition is waived for those individuals who qualify for such exemption under the provisions of the California Education Code (see section on fee waivers).</p> <p>Students are charged campus fees in addition to tuition and systemwide fees. Information on campus fees can be found by contacting the individual campus(es).</p> <h4>Credit Cards</h4> <p>Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover credit cards may be used for payment of student tuition and fees but may be subject to a non-refundable credit card processing fee.</p> <h2><a name="Establishment_or_Abolishment_of_Campus-Based_Mandatory_Fees"></a>Procedure for the Establishment or Abolishment of Campus-Based Mandatory Fees</h2> <p>The law governing the California State University provides that specific campus fees defined as mandatory, such as a <em>student association fee</em> and <em>a student center fee</em>, may be established. A <em>student association</em> fee must be established upon a favorable vote of two-thirds of the students voting in an election held for this purpose (Education Code, Section 89300). The campus president may adjust the student association fee only after the fee adjustment has been approved by a majority of students voting in a referendum established for that purpose. The required fee shall be subject to referendum at any time upon the presentation of a petition to the campus president containing the signatures of 10 percent of the regularly enrolled students at the university. Student association fees support a variety of cultural and recreational programs, childcare centers, and special student support programs. A student center fee may be established only after a fee referendum is held which approves by a two-thirds favorable vote the establishment of the fee (Education Code, Section 89304). Once bonds are issued, authority to set and adjust student center fees is governed by provisions of the State University Revenue Bond Act of 1947, including, but not limited to, Education Code sections 90012, 90027, and 90068.</p> <p>The process to establish and adjust other campus-based mandatory fees requires consideration by the campus fee advisory committee and a consultation or student referendum process as established by C<a href="https://calstate.policystat.com/policy/7459727/latest/">alifornia State University Student Fee Policy</a>, Section III (or any successor policy<u>)</u>. The campus president may use consultation mechanisms if he/she determines that a referendum is not the best mechanism to achieve appropriate and meaningful consultation, and referendum is not required by the Education Code or Student Success Fee policy. Results of the referendum and the fee committee review are advisory to the campus president. The president may adjust campus-based mandatory fees but must request the chancellor to establish a new mandatory fee. The president shall provide to the fee advisory committee a report of all campus-based mandatory fees. The campus shall report annually to the chancellor a complete inventory of all campus-based mandatory fees.</p> <p>For more information or questions, please contact the System Budget Office in the CSU Chancellor's Office at (562) 951-4560.</p> <h1><a name="Refund_Mandatory_Fees_Incl_Nonresident_Tuition"></a>Refund of Tuition and Mandatory Fees, Including Nonresident Tuition</h1> <p>Regulations governing the refund of tuition and mandatory fees, including nonresident tuition, for students enrolling at the California State University are included in Section 41802 of Title 5, California Code of Regulations. For purposes of the refund policy, mandatory fees are defined as those systemwide and campus fees that are required to be paid in order to enroll in state-supported academic programs at the CSU. Refunds of fees and tuition charges for self-support, special session and extended education programs or courses at the CSU are governed by a separate policy established by the university, available at <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/ceu/index.shtml">https://www.cpp.edu/ceu/index.shtml</a>.</p> <p>In order to receive a full refund of tuition and mandatory fees, including nonresident tuition, less an administrative charge established by the campus, a student must cancel registration or drop all courses prior to the first day of instruction for the term. Information on procedures and deadlines for canceling registration and dropping classes is available <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/studentsuccess/guides/registration-page.shtml">https://www.cpp.edu/studentsuccess/guides/registration-page.shtml</a>.</p> <p>For state-supported semesters, quarters and non-standard terms or courses of four weeks or more, a student who withdraws during the term in accordance with the university's established procedures or drops all courses prior to the campus-designated drop period will receive a refund of tuition and mandatory fees, including nonresident tuition, based on the portion of the term during which the student was enrolled. No student withdrawing after the 60 percent point in the term will be entitled to a refund of any mandatory fees or nonresident tuition.</p> <p>A student who, within the campus designated drop period and in accordance with campus procedures, drops units resulting in a lower tuition and/or mandatory fee obligation shall be entitled to a refund of applicable tuition and mandatory fees less an administrative charge established by the campus.</p> <p>For state-supported non-standard terms or courses of less than four weeks, no refunds of tuition and mandatory fees, including nonresident tuition, will be made unless a student cancels registration or drops all classes, in accordance with the university's established procedures and deadlines, prior to the first day of instruction for state-supported non-standard terms or courses or prior to the first meeting for courses of less than four weeks.</p> <p>Students will also receive a refund of tuition and mandatory fees, including nonresident tuition, under the following circumstances:</p> 
                  <ul> 
                   <li>The tuition and fees were assessed or collected in error;</li> 
                   <li>The course for which the tuition and fees were assessed or collected was canceled by the university;</li> 
                   <li>The university makes a delayed decision that the student was not eligible to enroll in the term for which tuition and mandatory fees were assessed and collected and the delayed decision was not due to incomplete or inaccurate information provided by the student; or</li> 
                   <li>The student was activated for compulsory military service.</li> 
                  </ul> <p>Students who are not entitled to a refund as described above may petition the university for a refund demonstrating exceptional circumstances and the chief financial officer of the university or designee may authorize a refund if he or she determines that the fees and tuition were not earned by the university.</p> <p>Information concerning any aspect of the refund of fees may be obtained from Amy Cher, Coordinator of Student Accounting, at (909) 869-2011.</p> <h3>Nonresident Tuition Fee Waiver</h3> <p>California school district employees who are not yet legal residents of California may be exempted from the nonresident tuition fee if they are provisionally certificated, employed full-time by a school district in a position requiring certification, and if they are working toward fulfilling regular California credential requirements or completing a fifth year of study.</p> <p>Children or spouses of the California State University employees are also eligible to apply for exemption from the nonresident fee.</p> <h3>Expenses (Estimated)</h3> <p>A student enrolling under the auspices of an agency supplying educational assistance should check in advance with the agency representative regarding payment of fees and/or costs.</p> <p>The total cost for students living away from home will vary. However, typical costs will amount to approximately $20,500 for a three-quarter school year, excluding personal and transportation expenses.</p> <p>Total expenses for nonresident and foreign students will be higher, as they will include tuition fees not required of legal California resident students.</p> <h1><a id="typical-on-campus-expenses-for-2019-2020-term" name="typical-on-campus-expenses-for-2019-2020-term"></a>Typical On-Campus Expenses for 2019-2020 Term</h1>

The average support cost is determined by dividing the total cost by the number of FTES. The total CSU 2020/21 budget amounts were $3,722,806,000 from state General Fund (GF) appropriations, before a $42.7 million CalPERS retirement adjustment, $2,626,783,000 from gross tuition revenue, and $612,221,000 from other fee revenues for a total of $6,961,810,000. The 2020/21 resident FTES target is 374,131 and the nonresident FTES based on past-year actual is 22,154 for a total of 396,285 FTES. The GF appropriation is applicable to resident students only whereas fee revenues are collected from resident and nonresident students. FTES is determined by dividing the total academic student load (e.g. 15 units per semester) (the figure used here to define a full-time student's academic load).</p>

The following information describes three different types of resources: (1) aid programs for students with financial need; (2) academic or merit scholarships awarded without consideration of need; and (3) alternative financing options available to students and parents. Seventy-five percent of Cal Poly Pomona's students receive aid through one or more of these options.</p> <p>Although every effort is made to present the most accurate and up-to-date information, this information is subject to change due to alterations in federal, state, University or lender policy or procedures. For additional information, please contact the Office of Financial Aid &amp; Scholarships.

Most males between the ages of 18 and 25 must be registered. Males born after December 31, 1959, may be required to submit a statement of compliance with the Act and regulations in order to receive any grant, loan, or work assistance under specified provisions of existing federal law. In California, students subject to the Act who fail to register are also ineligible to receive any need-based student grants funded by the state or a public postsecondary institution.</p> <p>Selective Service registration forms are available at any U.S. Post Office, and many high schools have a staff member or teacher appointed as a Selective Service Registrar. Applicants for financial aid can also request that information provided on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) be used to register them with the Selective Service. For more information on the Selective Service System and to initiate the registration process visit the <a href="http://www.sss.gov./">official Selective Service System website</a>.</p> <p>International students are ineligible to apply for any form of U.S. government financial aid.

The earlier the application, the better the chance that funds will be available. <u>Students must reapply for aid each year</u>. Students should complete this application as early as possible after October 1, but no later than the priority filing deadline of March 2.</p> <h3>Step 2 (Request for Documents)</h3> <p>Approximately four weeks after the FAFSA is filed, the central processing center will send a Student Aid Report (SAR) to the student and electronically transfer the application to the Office of Financial Aid &amp; Scholarships.

Students who qualify will receive a Financial Aid Offer letter outlining the types and amounts of awarded financial aid. Information is also provided at that time giving details about maintaining eligibility and the disbursement of aid. Typically, aid is disbursed at the beginning of each term. Financial Aid awards are based on full-time units (12 units or more). Some financial aid is adjusted if the student is enrolled in less than full-time units. Adjustments are made for two-term time (9-11 units), half-time (6-8 units), and less than half-time (1-5 units). Some aid types are not available for less than half-time enrollment.</p> <p>New applicants for Cal Grants will be notified by the California Student Aid Commission of their eligibility for Cal Grants; renewal recipients will be notified by the Cal Poly Pomona Office of Financial Aid &amp; Scholarships.</p> <h2><a name="Types_of_Need-Based_Programs"></a>Types of Need-Based Programs</h2> <p>Eligible students are offered a "package" which may consist of a combination of grants, work opportunities, and loans.
