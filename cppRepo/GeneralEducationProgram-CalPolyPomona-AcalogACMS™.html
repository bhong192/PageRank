The CPP GE program mission is designed to help students to succeed in their chosen field, adapt to a changing workplace, be engaged citizens in their communities, and become lifelong learners. It provides essential skills and knowledge through a framework that enhances students' understanding of basic disciplines and encourages an appreciation of the complexity of all knowledge.</p> <p>GE courses provide students with a broad intellectual foundation to enhance their potential for success. GE courses shall reflect the wide array of disciplines available, and departments are encouraged to submit courses for multiple GE areas. In recognition of the complexity of knowledge, these areas are defined with open and inclusive terms to encourage submission of courses that enrich the student learning experience. Departments are required to offer these courses at least once every five years, otherwise they will lose their GE designation.</p> <p>As directed by EO 1100 CSU General Education Breadth Requirements, the GE Assessment Committee develops a set of broad learning outcomes (SLOs) for the GE Program as a whole "to fit within the framework of the four Essential Learning Outcomes drawn from the Liberal Education and America's Promise (LEAP) campaign. As a result, there is not a one-to-one mapping from the outcomes to the GE Areas. Every course must address all of the SLOs assigned to the GE Area for which it is approved. However, approved courses need not cover every element of those SLOs. The GE Assessment Committee also develops an assessment plan as recommended by EO 1100 article 6.2.5 and a periodic program review of the GE program shall be undertaken in a manner comparable to major programs. The GE Committee in collaboration with the GE Assessment Committee shall have the responsibility.</p>

The learning that takes place in GE supplements and complements the academic major. GE brings together diverse ways of knowing and doing to strengthen foundational skills, drive innovation, and adapt to new opportunities. Furthermore, it enables us to develop a deep understanding of one's self and respect for the complex identities of others, and to face the critical and ethical decisions we encounter throughout our lives.</p>

                  </ol> <h1>Minimum Grades in General Education</h1> <p>Effective for new and returning students admitted fall 2015 or later, a grade of C- or better is required of each Cal Poly Pomona or transfer student completing courses in written communication in the English language (GE Sub-area A2), oral communication in the English language (GE Sub-area A1), critical thinking (GE Sub-area A3), and mathematics/quantitative reasoning (GE Sub-area B4).</p> <h1>General Education - Approved Coursework</h1> <p>Courses are approved by the Campus Academic Senate by area to meet the university general education program requirements. Coursework in General Education should not be taken without a specific curricular goal. Many degree programs recommend specific GE courses which also meet their degree requirements. Such departments will list these courses in their degree curriculum layouts and in their catalog section. Special Topics courses (those numbered 4990) are not eligible for GE credit. Students should consult with advisors in their major department. Undeclared students should consult with the staff of the Bronco Advising Center, Student Services Building, 1st Floor (Blue Counter).</p> <p>The framework, guidelines, and coursework approved to meet general education requirements may change subsequent to the publication of this catalog. Students who change majors or otherwise have a break in status may find that they are subject to new degree requirements. Careful academic and career planning is essential.</p> <p>Cal Poly Pomona offers students two curriculum patterns to satisfy GE requirements. In the University General Education pattern, which is open to all undergraduates, students select courses in five areas: English Language Communication and Critical Thinking, Scientific Inquiry and Quantitative Reasoning, Arts and Humanities, Social Sciences, and Lifelong Learning and Self-development. The University General Education pattern gives students an introduction to a wide variety of disciplines and teaching modes.</p> <p>Students must complete a minimum of nine semester units of upper division general education which may be taken no sooner than the semester in which the student achieves upper division status. Nine semester units of the total general education program must be completed in residence at Cal Poly Pomona.</p> <p>Courses listed as a sequence should be taken in order.

                  </ol> <h1>General Education Unit Distribution</h1> <p>Beginning fall 2018 all undergraduate students at Cal Poly Pomona must satisfy the general education requirements with a minimum and a maximum of 48 semester units, including 9 units of upper division synthesis courses. Lower division courses only shall be approved for the lower division GE Areas (The 9 upper division units shall be taken within the CSU to fulfill the CSU residency requirement.) EO 1100 2.2.2a says that a grade of C- (minus) or better is required in the "golden four' courses A1, A2, A3 and B4. In 2.2.5a EO 1100 says that a campus may waive one or more of the requirements of Title 5 and that the campus must have a clearly stated policy regarding such waivers. Courses are evaluated by a duly constituted GE Committee (which shall include a student representative) and are approved by the Academic Senate to meet the university general education program requirements. Since general education is under continual review, the framework, guidelines, and coursework approved to meet these requirements may change from one catalog cycle to another. Students who change majors or have a break in status may be subject to new degree requirements. Careful academic advising is essential. According to EO 1100, 2.2.6.1 major courses and campus wide required courses that are approved for GE credit shall also fulfill (double count for) the GE requirements. Many degree programs recommend specific GE courses which also meet degree requirements (double counting). Departments must indicate those courses on the curriculum sheet of each program.</p>

Courses satisfying the requirements for C3 may have prerequisites that are GE approved courses in specific disciplines (not specific courses) as long as the total number of units required as prerequisites does not exceed the minimum number of units to satisfy the lower division GE requirement (e.g. only the first semester of a sequence can be required).</p> <h3>Area D Social Sciences (9 semester units)</h3> <p>Students will learn from courses in multiple disciplines that human social, political, and economic institutions as well as history and human behavior are inextricably interwoven. Through fulfillment of the Area D requirement, students will develop an understanding of problems and issues from the respective disciplinary perspectives and will examine issues in their contemporary as well as historical settings and in a variety of cultural contexts. Students will explore the principles, methodologies, value systems, and ethics employed in social scientific inquiry. Courses that emphasize skills development and professional preparation shall not be included in Area D. Students must complete at least two lower division courses in two different disciplines (i.e. the 3 lower division area D courses cannot be completed in one disciple).&nbsp;</p> <p>Students are required to take one course from each subarea, D1, D2, and D4. Students who complete the IGE course sequence are exempt from this requirement since the IGE program by its very nature provides the necessary breadth. EO 1100 says in 2.2.6.2 campuses may include the United States History, Constitution, and American Ideals Requirement (Title 5 of the California Code of Regulations, Section 40404) in general education. This statute is met at Cal Poly Pomona by courses that satisfy these requirements as outlined in Executive Order 1061 and divided into D1 and D2 as follows:</p> <p><strong>D1: U.S. History and American Ideals (3 semester units) Ia, Ib, Ic, IIb, IIc, IIIa</strong><br> The GE Subarea provides partial fulfillment of the United States History, Constitution, and American Ideals Requirement (Title 5 of the California Code of Regulations, Section 40404,) outlined in Executive Order 1061,Paragraph I, A as follows:<br> <em>Any course or examination which addresses the historical development of American institutions and ideals must include all of the subject matter elements identified in the following subparagraphs of this paragraph. Nothing contained herein is intended to prescribe the total content or structure of any course.</em></p> <p style="margin-left:40px"><em>1. Significant events covering a minimum time span of approximately one hundred years occurring in the entire area now included in the United States of America, including the relationships of regions within that area and with external regions and powers as appropriate to the understanding of those events within the United States during the period under study.<br> 2. The role of major ethnic and social groups in such events and the contexts in which the events have occurred.<br> 3. The events presented within a framework which illustrates the continuity of the American experience and its derivation from other cultures including consideration of three or more of the following: politics, economics, social movements, and geography.</em></p> <p><strong>D2: US Constitution and California Government (3 semester units) Ia, Ib, Ic, IIc, IIIb, IVc</strong><br> The GE Subarea provides partial fulfillment of the United States History, Constitution, and American Ideals Requirement (Title 5 of the California Code of Regulations, Section 40404) as outlined in Executive Order 1061, Paragraph I, B as follows:<br> <em>Any course or examination which addresses the Constitution of the United States, the operation of representative democratic government under that Constitution, and the process of California State and local government must address all of the subject matter elements identified in the following subparagraph of this paragraph. Nothing contained herein is intended to prescribe the total content or structure of any course.</em></p> <p style="margin-left:40px"><em>1. The political philosophies of the framers of the Constitution and the nature and operation of United States political institutions and processes under that Constitution as amended and interpreted.<br> 2. The rights and obligations of citizens in the political system established under the Constitution.<br> 3.

Courses shall take a more integrative approach and examine the historical development and cross-cultural distribution of patterns of social behavior as well as different theories and approaches in the field.</p> <p>Students shall complete the lower division GE requirements in A1, A2, A3 and B4 and Area D (D1 and D2), before taking their upper division D4 course. Courses satisfying the requirements for D4 may have prerequisites that are GE approved courses in specific disciplines (not specific courses) as long as the total number of units required as prerequisites does not exceed the minimum number of units to satisfy the lower division GE requirement (e.g. only the first semester of a sequence can be required).</p> <h3>Area E Lifelong Learning and Self Development (3 semester units) Ia, IVa, IVb, IVc</h3> <p>The content of courses to fulfill Area E is designed to equip learners for lifelong understanding and development of themselves as integrated physiological, social, and psychological beings. Student learning in this area shall include selective consideration of content such as human behavior, sexuality, nutrition, physical and mental health, stress management, information literacy and student success strategies, social relationships and relationships with the environment, as well as implications of death and dying and avenues for lifelong learning. Physical activity may be included, provided that it is an integral part of the study elements described herein. Courses in this area, according to EO 1100, shall be lower division only.</p> <h3>Area F:&nbsp; Ethnic Studies (3 semester units) Ia, IVa, IVb</h3> <p>This 3-unit requirement fulfills Education Code Section 89032. The requirement to take a 3-unit course in Area F shall not be waived or substituted. To be approved for this requirement, courses shall have the EWS prefix. Courses without an ethnic studies prefix may meet this requirement if cross-listed with an EWS course. Courses that are approved to meet this requirement shall meet at least 3 of the 5 following core competencies. Campuses may add additional competencies to those listed.</p> 
                  <ol start="1"> 
                   <li>Analyze and articulate concepts such as race and racism, racialization, ethnicity, equity, ethno-centrism, eurocentrism, white supremacy, self-determination, liberation, decolonization, sovereignty, imperialism, settler colonialism, and anti-racism as analyzed in any one or more of the following: Native American Studies, African American Studies, Asian American Studies, and Latina and Latino American Studies.</li> 
                   <li>Apply theory and knowledge produced by Native American, African American, Asian American, and/or Latina and Latino American communities to describe the critical events, histories, cultures, intellectual traditions, contributions, lived-experiences and social struggles of those groups with a particular emphasis on agency and group-affirmation.</li> 
                   <li>Critically analyze the intersection of race and racism as they relate to class, gender, sexuality, religion, spirituality, national origin, immigration status, ability, tribal citizenship, sovereignty, language, and/or age in Native American, African American, Asian American, and/or Latina and Latino American communities.</li> 
                   <li>Critically review how struggle, resistance, racial and social justice, solidarity, and liberation, as experienced and enacted by Native Americans, African Americans, Asian Americans and/or Latina and Latino Americans are relevant to current and structural issues such as communal, national, international, and transnational politics as, for example, in immigration, reparations, settler-colonialism, multiculturalism, language policies.</li> 
                   <li>Describe and actively engage with anti-racist and anti-colonial issues and the practices and movements in Native American, African American, Asian American and/or Latina and Latino communities and a just and equitable society.</li> 
                  </ol> <p><strong>General Education Meaningful Writing Component</strong><br> All General Education requirements must include a meaningful writing component as defined by the Academic Senate in 2006:<br> <em>Courses with a meaningful writing component must make use of written work to help students reflect upon ideas, analyze concepts, and explore relationships of concepts to one another. The written work must help students deepen their understanding of particular fields, enabling them to create meaning out of raw data and helping them express that meaning intelligibly to others. Written assignments must be structured to help students achieve specific course outcomes, and the students must receive feedback on their written work during - not solely at the end - of the [semester] of instruction.</em></p> <h1>Interdisciplinary Synthesis Courses</h1> <p>An interdisciplinary synthesis course integrates two or more of the Areas B, C, and D. Prior to taking one of these courses, students must complete all lower-division courses in Area A and at least two sub-areas from the areas being integrated by an interdisciplinary synthesis course.</p> <p>Each interdisciplinary synthesis course can be used to satisfy the requirement in any one of the areas integrated. For example, a B5/D4 course satisfies either B5 or D4 (not both areas). Students must fulfill all three synthesis areas (science and technology, arts and humanities, and social sciences).</p> <h1>Interdisciplinary General Education</h1> <p>IGE is an alternative pattern to satisfy 18 units of the University GE requirements in areas A2, C1, C2, D1, and Upper Division C3 or D4. Students ready for GE area A2 (category II) are eligible to enroll in <a href="preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=57&amp;coid=263957" onclick="acalogPopup('preview_course.php?catoid=57&amp;coid=263957&amp;print', '3', 770, 530, 'yes');return false;" rel="remote /ajax/preview_course.php?catoid=57&amp;coid=263957&amp;display_options[location]=tooltip&amp;show" id="tt2243" target="_blank">IGE 1100</a><span style="display: none !important">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;in the Fall. Students taking English Stretch can start IGE in fall with their A2 satisfied.</p> <p>The Interdisciplinary General Education Program (IGE) provides an interdisciplinary undergraduate general education experience that prepares students to lead socially responsible, productive, and satisfying lives in a changing diverse world. IGE combines intellectual inquiry with creativity to provide a rich learning environment. Students enter IGE as a cohort and travel through the program together. It is an option for first-time freshmen, with the option to opt out after the first, second, or third years. IGE also offers a number of stand-alone Upper Division GE Synthesis Courses covering C3 and D4. Contact the IGE Department for more information.</p> <p>You can find more information about the IGE Program on the IGE Program <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/~ceis/interdisciplinary-general-education/program-information/ige-courses.shtml">website</a>.</p> <p>The IGE Arts Package offers a set of theater, music, and other experiences that augment the curriculum and build the community.</p> <h6>FIRST YEAR</h6> <p><a href="preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=57&amp;coid=263957" onclick="acalogPopup('preview_course.php?catoid=57&amp;coid=263957&amp;print', '3', 770, 530, 'yes');return false;" rel="remote /ajax/preview_course.php?catoid=57&amp;coid=263957&amp;display_options[location]=tooltip&amp;show" id="tt9441" target="_blank">IGE 1100 Consciousness and Community (3)</a><span style="display: none !important">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p> <p><a href="preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=57&amp;coid=266721" onclick="acalogPopup('preview_course.php?catoid=57&amp;coid=266721&amp;print', '3', 770, 530, 'yes');return false;" rel="remote /ajax/preview_course.php?catoid=57&amp;coid=266721&amp;display_options[location]=tooltip&amp;show" id="tt5677" target="_blank">IGE 1200 Authority and Faith: Ancient and Medieval Worlds (3)</a><span style="display: none !important">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>SECONDYEAR</strong></p> <p><a href="preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=57&amp;coid=271723" onclick="acalogPopup('preview_course.php?catoid=57&amp;coid=271723&amp;print', '3', 770, 530, 'yes');return false;" rel="remote /ajax/preview_course.php?catoid=57&amp;coid=271723&amp;display_options[location]=tooltip&amp;show" id="tt2219" target="_blank">IGE 2150 Ways of Doing: Culture, Society, Science, and Sustainability (3) </a><span style="display: none !important">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<br> <a href="preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=57&amp;coid=271724" onclick="acalogPopup('preview_course.php?catoid=57&amp;coid=271724&amp;print', '3', 770, 530, 'yes');return false;" rel="remote /ajax/preview_course.php?catoid=57&amp;coid=271724&amp;display_options[location]=tooltip&amp;show" id="tt3653" target="_blank">IGE 2250 Encountering Difference: Culture and Power (3)</a><span style="display: none !important">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>THIRD YEAR</strong></p> <p><a href="preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=57&amp;coid=271725" onclick="acalogPopup('preview_course.php?catoid=57&amp;coid=271725&amp;print', '3', 770, 530, 'yes');return false;" rel="remote /ajax/preview_course.php?catoid=57&amp;coid=271725&amp;display_options[location]=tooltip&amp;show" id="tt4967" target="_blank">IGE 2350 Empires, States, and Peoples: Cultural Contact and Exchange (3)</a><span style="display: none !important">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<br> <a href="preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=57&amp;coid=263962" onclick="acalogPopup('preview_course.php?catoid=57&amp;coid=263962&amp;print', '3', 770, 530, 'yes');return false;" rel="remote /ajax/preview_course.php?catoid=57&amp;coid=263962&amp;display_options[location]=tooltip&amp;show" id="tt3392" target="_blank">IGE 3100 Interdisciplinary Perspectives: Capstone Seminar (3)</a><span style="display: none !important">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p> <p>IGE students will take remaining GE courses from the current approved GE list to complete the total units required.&nbsp;</p> <h1>Transfer Students and GE Certification</h1> <p>Community college transfer students should be aware that many courses on the Cal Poly Pomona General Education list are also major department entrance or prerequisite requirements and will still have to be taken to meet degree requirements. Therefore, even if they may be certified by their community colleges as having met all (or most) CSU lower division general education requirements, or have met GE requirements prior to change of major, they may need to take additional courses to satisfy prerequisites for the major. For example, students may have met the quantitative reasoning requirement by taking a trigonometry course at the community college, or at Cal Poly Pomona, and be so certified. This will not meet the calculus requirement for engineering, which also meets the Cal Poly Pomona GE quantitative reasoning requirement. Calculus will still have to be taken. Such "excess" coursework will be given as "elective credit." Some transfer students without a complete GE certification may be partially certified by their community colleges as having met the CSU General Education quantitative reasoning requirement with coursework which does not meet the Cal Poly Pomona Mathematics proficiency requirement. Such students will also have to take coursework to meet this graduation requirement.</p> <p>Transfer students may satisfy CSU lower division General Education requirements through certification of courses that satisfy the CSU General Education-Breadth Requirements or the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (IGETC). Contact your community college counselor for more details.</p>
