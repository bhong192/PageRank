International students admitted to Cal Poly Pomona and visiting international scholars are required to report to the International Center at the beginning of their first semester for document processing. A team of professional advisors, helpful administrative support staff and trained student assistants are&nbsp;available daily in the International Center, Building 1, Room 104.</p> <p>International students coming to Cal Poly Pomona find support services and advocacy in the International Center. The Center is available to ease arrival, help students comply with federal immigration laws and registration requirements, provide a new student orientation geared to your special needs, identify worthwhile campus programs and activities, and offer extensive advising services (immigration, personal finance, academic issues, and personal concerns). International Center staff may be able to assist you with admissions and registration and to understand U.S. higher education. In-coming freshmen from abroad are strongly encouraged to enroll in a 2-unit class that is geared to improve performance and ease the transition.</p> <p>As the locus for expertise on matters relating to United States Immigration and Naturalization Services (INS) regulations, we keep international students informed through timely e-mail newsletters and announcements of the pertinent rules that affect you. While most students will enter on F1 visas, for government-sponsored students, the Center will initiate IAP-66 paperwork for initial entry into the U.S. The International Center&nbsp;offers programs and assistance to all students in extending visas, if this becomes necessary. A main goal is to keep all students in proper immigration status and thereby facilitate the educational process.</p> <p>At the same time, the International Center aspires to be a recognized leader among international student service units nationally and periodically asks you for ideas on programs and issues that will improve programming aimed at a full, cross-cultural immersion experience&nbsp;for Cal Poly Pomona international students. Leadership training, special programs informing students about local and state government, education, medical care, arts, judicial matters, business and related topics are part of the orientation course. Special trips to places of interest are part of the program. In addition, students who complete one year at Cal Poly Pomona, may apply for merit scholarships and loan funds administered by the International Center.</p> <p>A number of international scholars visit Cal Poly Pomona each year, some for a few days and some for extended stays. The International Center has personnel experienced with the immigration and taxation issues that affect all such scholars and their academic hosts. Visa category has a major influence on the kinds, if any, of remuneration a scholar may receive and on the IRS requirements for income tax withholding. Academic and service units are encouraged to seek advice from the International Center before entering into arrangements that involve payments, including in-kind.</p> <p>The International Center is especially interested in making contact with visiting scholars on our campus for extended stays. We want to establish more accurate numerical, geographic and disciplinary information on visiting scholars and their host units. Often the presence of a visiting scholar in one program will be of wider campus interest and the International Center aims to broaden the impact of scholars whenever possible. The Faculty Associates of the International Center form the academic heart of the International Center, and can provide departmental contacts for visiting scholars.</p> <p>For further information see <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/~international">https://www.cpp.edu/~international</a>, call 909-869-3335, or fax 909-869-3282.</p> <h2><a name="University_Police"></a>University Police</h2> <p>The University Police &amp; Parking Services is comprised of sworn police officers, parking officers, public safety specialist, management, staff, and student assistants.

There are many types of advisor available to assist students:</p> 
                  <ul> 
                   <li>Each College has an Advising Center or Student Success Center that includes staff advisors available to help students with this process. Staff advisors can assist with general degree requirement information, navigating university processes, completing petitions, and more.</li>

Cal Poly Pomona is one of 600 institutions nationwide that offer Army ROTC through cross-enrollment with host institutions. Students from Cal Poly Pomona attend Military Science classes at Cal Poly Pomona and participate fully in the Army ROTC. Although Army ROTC is traditionally a four-year program, a two-year program is offered to students completing a six week summer camp and to selected veterans.</p> <p>Army ROTC aids students by providing leadership and management experience found in few other college courses as well as an opportunity for a military career in the Active Army, Army National Guard, or the U.S. Army Reserve. It develops self-discipline, physical stamina and poise while enhancing development of management skills and qualities basic to success in any career. It also provides academic credit for classroom instruction and a stipend of $420.00 each month during the final two years of the program.</p> <p>The four-year program consists of a two-year Basic Course and a two-year Advanced Course. The Basic Course is normally taken during the freshman and sophomore years. The Basic Course imposes no military obligation on the part of the students; they may withdraw at any time before the end of the second year. Students with active duty military experience in any of the armed forces may have the first two years waived.</p> <p>The Advanced Course provides further instruction in leadership development, organization and management, and tactics and administration. Attendance at all leadership laboratories and field trips () is mandatory for all Advanced Course cadets. Advanced Course cadets attend a six-week advanced camp in the summer between their junior and senior years of college. This camp permits Cadets to put into practice the principles and theories they have acquired from classroom instruction. Cadets receive approximately $880.00 in pay, plus travel expenses, room and board, medical care, and other benefits.</p> <p>The two-year program permits students with prior military experience or those who complete a six-week basic camp to enter the Advanced course and receive the same instruction and financial assistance. Applicants for the Basic camp should apply to the Army ROTC, California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, campus during the spring preceding the summer Basic camp.</p> <p>Army ROTC scholarships for full tuition, fees, books of up to $5,000 a semester are offered to students who are enrolled or are preparing to enroll in Army ROTC.&nbsp;These scholarships are for three years. Three-year competitive scholarships are available to students attending college at the time of application; this includes students enrolled in the Cal Poly Pomona Army ROTC program. Applications and further information can be obtained by writing Army ROTC, California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, CA 91768, or by calling (909) 869-3266.</p> <p>Courses offered at Cal Poly Pomona are listed in the catalog section "University Programs."</p> <h2><a name="Air_Force_Reserve_Officers_Training_Corps__AFROTC_"></a>Air Force Reserve Officers Training Corps (AFROTC)</h2> <p>Through arrangements with California State University, San Bernardino (CSU-SB), Loyola Marymount University (LMU) in west Los Angeles, the University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA), and the University of Southern California (USC), students may participate in the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) program. Aerospace Studies classes and Leadership Laboratories are conducted at various times during the week on the main campuses of CSU-SB, LMU, UCLA and USC.</p> <p>AFROTC offers a variety of two, three and four year scholarships, many of which pay the full cost of tuition, books, and fees. Successful completion of as little as four semesters of AFROTC academic classes and leadership laboratories can lead to a commission as a second lieutenant in the United States Air Force.</p> <p>Classes consist of one hour of academics and two hours of laboratory for freshman and sophomores; three hours of academics and two hours of laboratory for juniors and seniors. AFROTC cadets under scholarship and all juniors and seniors receive a monthly tax-free stipend and a textbook allowance. No military commitment is incurred until entering the last two years of the program (Professional Officer Course) or accepting an AFROTC scholarship.</p> <p>For more information, contact the Department of Aerospace Studies (AFROTC) at one of the following universities: CSU-San Bernardino at (909) 537-5440, Loyola Marymount University at (310) 338-2770, UCLA at (310) 825-1742, or USC at (213) 740-2670.</p> <h2><a name="Study_Abroad__Exchanges__and_Overseas_Internships"></a>Study Abroad, Exchanges, and Overseas Internships</h2> <p>Developing intercultural communication skills and international understanding among its students is a vital mission of The California State University (CSU). On behalf of Cal Poly Pomona students, the International Center (Building 1, Room 104) encourages and facilitates student study abroad for a semester or longer. Our staff assist students with selecting a study abroad program, completing applications, registering for courses, and arranging for transfer of overseas credits to Cal Poly Pomona. Financial aid, with the exception of Federal Work Study, is available to qualified students. We work closely with the Financial Aid Office toward a goal of assuring that all students can afford the international experience; we also can provide some need and merit-based scholarships. All CPP approved and sponsored study and travel abroad programs that offer 6 or more credits allow students to use their federal financial aid. Consult a counselor in the Financial Aid Office (Building 121, 1st floor) and apply early.</p> <p>Students study abroad to broaden their education and personal experience. It is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for most young people. In our increasingly global economy with issues of health, politics, society and resources that transcend national borders, many study abroad returnees find enhanced job opportunities.</p> <p>Among Cal Poly Pomona overseas opportunities is the Spring London Quarter. Cal Poly Pomona faculty offer regular classes in London, England. Students enroll for 17 units which include an extensive set of activities that make use of London and its surrounding areas. Courses and faculty are carefully selected to ensure the program's usefulness to the majority of students, the highest quality teaching, and full use of London's historic and noteworthy attractions. Our partner, Anglo American Educational Services provides outstanding student services in London. For information, please consult with International Center study abroad staff or the dean's office in College of Business Administration or College of Letters, Arts, and Social Sciences. The program is open to 35-60 students, accompanied by two or three Cal Poly Pomona faculty.</p> <p>Students studying French as part of their program may opt to join the language and culture program in Paris, at the Sorbonne (6 units). Architecture students can opt for a program that includes Greece, France, and Germany (10-12 units). These are programs the colleges and schools offer each summer.</p> <p>Cal Poly Pomona offers an exciting range of summer session overseas programs that are affordable. Students can choose to enroll in any of a number of programs around the world including sites in France, Germany, Morocco, China, Italy, Ghana, Spain and others. Enrollment determines the sites approved on a yearly basis. One or more Cal Poly Pomona faculty accompany students on most programs and are responsible for the evaluation of student work. Need and merit-based scholarships are available.</p> <p>For students who are more interested in a cultural immersion experience with only one or several other Cal Poly Pomona students, the International Center can recommend a number of outstanding programs that are available from universities abroad with whom we have formal exchange agreements. Students apply through the International Center. Cal Poly Pomona students can study in specialized as well as general liberal arts fields. Students from the professional schools and colleges, natural and physical sciences, arts, humanities and social sciences will find a wealth of appropriate courses available, in English, as well as several other languages. For example, engineers, behavioral science students and others will find coursework offered in English, in Korea and Germany, as well as options in England, Scotland, and Australia. For students interested in Asia or in their own heritage, language and culture, study is available in China, Korea, Japan, and elsewhere. Several partner universities in Mexico offer Spanish language training, sometimes in combination with business courses.</p> <p>Cal Poly Pomona maintains a balance between in-coming and out-going students with each partner institution abroad. Students pay Cal Poly Pomona fees (and tuition in the case of non-residents) and are responsible for their room, board and related expenses while abroad. The cost of exchange may be less or more than attending Cal Poly Pomona, depending on the location and student interest in additional travel. There are many opportunities for cultural, linguistic and educational immersion abroad for those who have second language capability--Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Spanish, German, French, Greek, Arabic, and Thai. The exchange programs run for one or two semesters and generally have an April 1 deadline for Fall semester, and October 1 for Spring semester. In most cases, financial aid can be applied toward program cost.</p> <p>Students on study abroad and internship abroad programs agree to comply with academic requirements, the CPP student code and university regulations, host university regulations, and laws of the host country. Study abroad students must have insurance coverage while abroad, including medical, medical evacuation and repatriation of remains. Additional medical insurance is available for most programs and several have insurance as part of the program costs. Before departing, participants in Cal Poly Pomona programs have a general health examination (arranged with the Health Center).</p> <p>The International Center facility provides an inviting location for domestic and international students to meet, obtain information about overseas study, read about current events from U.S., Asian and other national perspectives, and share their experiences. A media center is available for viewing videos and CD-ROMS of exchange and CSU International Programs sites.</p> <p>For further information see <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/~international">https://www.cpp.edu/~international</a>, or contact us at (909) 869-3267, or <a href="mailto:international@cpp.edu" target="_blank">international@cpp.edu</a>.</p> <h2><a name="The_California_State_University_International_Programs"></a>International Programs</h2> <p>The International Center serves as the administrator for the year-long academic programs offered by California State University International Programs.

Established in 1969, the program serves low-income California residents who demonstrate the motivation and potential to succeed in college. Although 98 percent of EOP students entering Cal Poly Pomona meet the University's regular admission requirements, the program may provide access for a limited number of first-time freshmen who do not qualify for regular admission, depending upon enrollment restrictions. EOP promotes equity ("leveling the playing field") by providing participants with a broad range of support services throughout their undergraduate enrollment, if&nbsp;they maintain full-time status, make satisfactory academic progress, and fulfill program requirements.</p> <p>Among the services provided by EOP are supplemental academic advising and coaching for First-Generation college students, academic success seminars to develop effective study skills and enhance academic performance, peer mentoring, financial literacy support, graduate school preparation, and student activities to build community and an appreciation for EOP's rich history.</p> <p>EOP also offers a variety of peer-facilitated academic services through our EOP Learning Center.&nbsp;Free services include one-to-one&nbsp;tutoring sessions for a variety of CPP courses and written/oral assignments;&nbsp;a dedicated study space with drop-in tutors; and digital academic skills learning content.</p> <p>To apply for admission to the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP), prospective first-time freshmen or transfer students must complete and submit the online undergraduate CSU Cal State Apply application at&nbsp;<a href="https://www2.calstate.edu/apply">https://www2.calstate.edu/apply</a>. The filing period for fall semester is from October to January 15th. In addition to the EOP application, two Online Recommendation Forms are required.&nbsp; All EOP applicants must submit a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) or the California Dream Act Application by March 2nd. All applicants are encouraged to apply as early as possible during the application filing period.</p> <p>Once an EOP applicant's file is complete, it will be&nbsp;reviewed by the EOP Admissions and Enrollment Committee. The committee will not consider an applicant unless documents and forms required by the University's Admissions Office have been received and the applicant has been admitted to the university.&nbsp; The EOP Admissions and Enrollment Committee will consider such factors as the applicant's socioeconomic background, previous academic performance, co-curricular activities, two Online Recommendation Forms, motivation for active participation in EOP, and potential for success at Cal Poly Pomona. The committee may also look for additional contributions that the applicant has made or intends to make to his or her community. It is important that applicants complete the EOP application and all forms completely and accurately in order to assist the committee in evaluating their application. Some applicants may be required to come to campus for an in-person interview or via telephone. Applicants will be notified if an interview is required.</p> <p>After an applicant's file has been reviewed and a decision has been reached, the Executive Director of Student Support and Equity Programs (SSEP) will notify the applicant of the decision via email. An offer and EOP Acceptance Agreement will be emailed to applicants who have been selected for the program. The EOP Acceptance Agreement must be electronically signed and submitted to the EOP Admissions and Enrollment Services office by the given deadline.

These programs are designed to help eligible incoming EOP students transition from high school or community college to the more challenging environment of the University.</p> <h3>Summer Bridge</h3> <p>Initiated at Cal Poly Pomona in the summer of 1985, the Summer Bridge Program is a five-week residential and commuter program that assists students in making the transition from high school to the more challenging environment of the University. The program provides a preview of the college experience and helps students build academic skills to be successful at Cal Poly Pomona.</p> <p>Summer Bridge offers an Ethnic and Women's Studies (EWS) course&nbsp;that help sharpen skills in reading, writing, and critical thinking. In addition, strategic study sessions, one-to-one tutoring, workshops, and other activities are included in the Summer Bridge experience. Students participating in the program receive academic advising, registration assistance, and opportunities to connect and build a support network with other students and campus resources. The University covers all direct costs, including registration fees, room, board, and books.</p> <p>EOP first-time freshmen are eligible to participate in the Summer Bridge Program. Some students may be required to attend as a condition of their acceptance into EOP.</p> <p>For additional information, please call the Transition Programs Coordinator at (909) 869-3994 or email <a href="mailto:summerbridge@cpp.edu">summerbridge@cpp.edu</a>.</p> <h3>Transfer Bridge</h3> <p>Transfer Bridge&nbsp;is a three-day commuter summer transition program for incoming Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) transfer students. While transfer students have had some college experience, transitioning to a new institution requires an understanding of new policies, deadlines, requirements, academic programs, campus resources, and campus life.</p> <p>EOP incoming transfer students are&nbsp;<strong>highly</strong>&nbsp;encouraged to come to Transfer Bridge. This program helps students get a great head start on their college experience at Cal Poly Pomona and connect to EOP advisors, staff, student leaders, and peers, who will become their support network.</p> <p>Past transfer&nbsp;students have found the EOP Transfer Bridge program extremely helpful, particularly being able to meet students that will start with them in the fall, review their transfer credit report, and receive information about financial aid and scholarships.</p> <p>For additional information, please contact the Transition Programs Coordinator at (909) 869 - 3994 or email <a href="mailto:transferbridge@cpp.edu">transferbridge@cpp.edu</a>.</p> <h2><a name="Renaissance_Scholars"></a>Renaissance Scholars</h2> <p>The Renaissance Scholars (RS) program is a comprehensive support program that is dedicated to promoting a successful transition out of foster care into higher education. The purpose is to provide former foster youth with educational experiences and a nurturing environment that can afford them the opportunity to obtain a college degree. The program meets the needs of students by providing enrichment activities, workshops, mentoring, tutoring, academic advising, success seminars, access to year-round housing, financial assistance, and community building activities. RS graduates are successful due to the comprehensive support structure of the program.</p> <p>Created in January 2002, Renaissance Scholars has grown from 10 students to a current class size of 60. Students are former foster youth that were in the system between the ages of 13 and 18, therefore, meeting the minimum eligibility for this program. RS assists youth in redefining who they are, breaking the cycle of abuse or poverty, and transforming their future. The participant demographics reflect the campus' strong commitment to diversity. Nationally, less than 5% of all former foster youth will graduate from college. RS is helping to repair that statistic. Currently, the RS graduation rate is over 50%. RS students are beating the odds by investing in themselves and attending college.</p> <p>To apply for admission to the Renaissance Scholars program, prospective first-time freshmen or transfer students must complete and submit the online undergraduate CSU application and EOP online application at <a href="http://www2.calstate.edu/apply">http://www2.calstate.edu/apply</a>,&nbsp;complete the RS Application at&nbsp; <a href="https://cpp.formstack.com/forms/rs_application_2020">https://cpp.formstack.com/forms/rs_application_2020</a> and submit by January 15.&nbsp; In addition to these forms, all applicants must submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) by the Priority Deadline of March 2 and qualify as an "independent" student under federal financial aid guidelines.</p> <p>Once an RS applicant's file is complete, it will be carefully reviewed by the RS Admissions Committee.
