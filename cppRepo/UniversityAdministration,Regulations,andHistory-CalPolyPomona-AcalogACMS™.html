                  </ul> <p><strong>Governance</strong></p> <p>The CSU is governed by the Board of Trustees, most of whom are appointed by the governor and serve with faculty and student representatives. The CSU Chancellor is the chief executive officer, reporting to the board. The campus presidents serve as the campus-level chief executive officers. The trustees, chancellor and presidents develop university-wide educational policy. The presidents, in consultation with the CSU Academic Senate and other campus stakeholder groups, render and implement local policy decisions.</p> <p><strong>CSU Historical Milestones</strong></p> <p>The individual California State Colleges were&nbsp;established as a system with a Board of Trustees and a chancellor in 1960 by the Donahoe Higher Education Act. In 1972, the system was designated as the California State University and Colleges, and in 1982 the system became the California State University. Today, the CSU is comprised of 23 campuses, including comprehensive and polytechnic universities and, since July 1995, the California Maritime Academy, a specialized campus.</p> <p>The oldest campus-San José State University-was founded in 1857 and became the first institution of public higher education in California. The newest-California State University Channel Islands-opened in fall 2002, with freshmen arriving in fall 2003.</p> <p>In 1963, the CSU's Academic Senate was established to act as the official voice of CSU faculty in university-wide matters. Also, the California State College Student Presidents Association-which was later renamed the California State Student Association, was founded to represent each campus student association on issues affecting students.</p> <p>Through its many decades of service, the CSU has continued to adapt to address societal changes, student needs and workforce trends. While the CSU's core mission has always focused on providing high-quality, affordable bachelor's and master's degree programs, over time the university has added a wide range of services and programs to support student success - from adding health centers and special programs for veterans to building student residential facilities to provide a comprehensive educational experience.</p> <p>To improve degree completion and accommodate students working full or part-time, the educational paradigm was expanded to give students the ability to complete upper-division and graduate requirements through part-time, late afternoon, and evening study. The university also expanded its programs to include a variety of teaching and school service credential programs, specially designed for working professionals.</p> <p>In 2010, in an effort to accommodate community college transfer students, the CSU, in concert with the California Community Colleges (CCC), launched the Associate Degree for Transfer (ADT), which guarantees CCC transfer students with an ADT admission to the CSU with junior status. The ADT has since proven to be the most effective path to a CSU for transfer students.</p> <p>Always adapting to changes in technology and societal trends to support student learning and degree completion, the CSU launched CourseMatch, which enables CSU students to complete online courses at other CSU campuses, expanding enrollment opportunities and providing more educational opportunities for student who may prefer an online format to a traditional classroom setting.</p> <p>The CSU marked a significant educational milestone whne it broadened its degree offerings to include doctoral degrees. The CSU independently offers Doctor of Education (Ed.D), Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT), Doctor of Audiology (AuD) and Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) degree programs. Additionally, the CSU was recently authorized to offer the independent Doctor of Occupational Therapy (OTD). A limited number of other doctoral degrees are offered jointly with the University of California and private institutions in California.</p> <p>The CSU strives to continually develop innovative programs, services and opportunities that will give students the tools they need to meet their full potential. In 2016, the university launched Graduation Initiative 2025, a bold plan to support students, increase the number of California's graduates earning high-quality degrees and eliminate achievement and equity gaps for all students. Through this initiative, the CSU is ensuring that all students have the opportunity to graduate according to their personal goals, positively impacting their lives, families, and communities.</p> <p>By providing an accessible, hands-on education that prepares graduates for career success, the CSU has created a network of alumni that is so extensive and renowned that it spans across the globe. As of 2020-21, more than 3.9 million CSU alumni are making a difference in the lives of the people of California and the world.</p> <h2><a id="Trustees_of_The_California_State_University" name="Trustees_of_The_California_State_University"></a>Trustees of The California State University</h2> <p><strong>EX OFFICIO TRUSTEES</strong></p> <p>The Honorable Gavin Newsom<br> Governor of California</p> <p>The Honorable Eleni Kounalakis<br> Lieutenant Governor of California</p> <p>The Honorable Anthony Rendon<br> Speaker of the Assembly</p> <p>The Honorable Tony Thurmond<br> State Superintendent of Public Instruction</p> <p>Dr. Joseph I.

                    <p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px">Cal Poly Pomona has a new seal, which pays homage to the university's unique history. In the foreground is an Arabian horse, inspired by Antez, one of W.K. Kellogg's favorites. The horse stables, designed by famed architect Myron Hunt, honor the past but are even more prominent today as the home to the university's student life offices. The palm trees and San Gabriel Mountains highlight Cal Poly Pomona's beauty and our historical roots in Southern California. You also might notice a pattern of threes - stable doors, mountain peaks and palm trees - which are a symbolic nod to the three elements of a polytechnic education that have been hallmarks since 1938: Creativity. Discovery. Innovation.</p>

Hundreds of students, prospective students, parents, alumni and friends of the university, along with many who might have heard of Cal Poly Pomona but knew little about it, shared their perceptions. Then we collaborated. Eight committees, with members drawn from all parts of the university community, assessed the findings and added their insights. They explored the university's rich history, its mission, its vital role in the region, and its commitment to helping first-generation students achieve career success.</p> <p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px">The result is a new logo that points the university toward the future. The octagon shape reflects the eight academic colleges and the eight elements of an inclusive polytechnic education, which are described in the university's new <a href="http://www.cpp.edu/~academicplan/index.shtml">Academic Master Plan</a>. The multiple facets of the octagon symbolize the interdependent nature of a Cal Poly Pomona education inside and outside the classroom.</p> <p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px">&nbsp;And as you can see, we also adopted a new bold color- blue - to further distinguish ourselves. The traditional green and gold remain and are found in the octagon's arrow, which conveys that we are a campus on the move, constantly seeking to improve and progress. The wordmark, <em>CalPoly Pomona</em>, is intrinsic to the logo and underscores the university's deep connection with its namesake city.</p> <p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px">&nbsp;You will find the new logo across the campus, on banners and in the bookstore, and proudly worn by members of the university community.</p> <h2><a name="Associated_Students__Inc._and_The_Bronco_Student_Center"></a>Associated Students, Inc.</h2> <p>Established in 1963, Associated Students, Inc.

Since 1957, Cal Poly Pomona has awarded more than 150,000 bachelor's degrees and 15,000 master's degrees.</p> <p>Our undergraduate degree programs require between 120 and 150 semester&nbsp;units for a bachelor's degree (equivalent to 180 and 225 quarter units). The majority of our academic programs can be completed within two years for transfer students or four years for freshman, as only a few programs require more than 120 semester units for graduation. Students who wish to finish college in two or four years must attend school each fall and spring semester and complete an average of 15 units per semester or 30 units per academic year (includes summer term). As a rule of thumb, these unit loads translates into 30 to 45 study hours per week outside of class. In addition, students who wish to graduate in four years must plan a schedule of courses using CPP Connect's Planner, with the help of academic advisors, that will enable them to progress through course sequences in their major while interweaving appropriate breadth courses in general education.</p> <p>The proportion of an entering student class or cohort who graduate in a specified time period is the measure used at Cal Poly Pomona to assess baccalaureate program completions. The four year and six year first-time freshmen rate for those regularly admitted students carrying a full-time unit load is the statistic most often used to compare one higher education institution with another. Twenty-seven percent of the fall 2016 regularly admitted, full-time, first-time freshman cohort at Cal Poly Pomona graduated within four years, and sixty-seven percent of the fall 2014 cohort graduated within six years. This rate compares very favorably with neighboring institutions of higher education, the CSU systemwide average, and with public universities nationally.</p> <p>Information regarding student persistence and graduation rates at Cal Poly Pomona may be obtained from the Office of Institutional Research, Planning and Analytics, located in Building 98 room C6-14, or by amail at <a href="mailto:irpa@cpp.edu">irpa@cpp.edu</a>.</p> <h1><a id="University_History" name="University_History">University History</a></h1> <h2><a name="Historical_Development"></a>Historical Development</h2> <p>In 1966, the California Legislature established California State Polytechnic College, Kellogg-Voorhis, as an independent state college. Thus ended almost three decades of direct legal and administrative relationship between this institution and its parent institution, Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. In the last 50 years, Cal Poly Pomona's expansive campus has grown from its humble beginnings as a horse ranch to a university with approximately 25,326&nbsp;students and 2,440 faculty and staff members. Three men played a vital role in this remarkable transformation: W. K. Kellogg, Charles B. Voorhis, and Julian McPhee.</p> <h2><a name="W._K._Kellogg_Develops_Arabian_Horse_Ranch"></a>W. K. Kellogg Develops Arabian Horse Ranch</h2> <p>W. K. Kellogg, known for his famous "corn flakes," had a life-long passion for Arabian horses. After purchasing 377 acres at a cost of $25,000, Kellogg developed the land into a world-renowned Arabian horse ranch. The first building erected contained the horse stables. Now renamed the University Plaza, Kellogg affectionately called the hacienda-style building his "Arabian Palace."</p> <p>On May 17, 1932, a crowd of more than 20,000 spectators converged on the ranch to witness Kellogg's donation of his Arabian Horse Ranch, including 87 horses, to the University of California. In return for the generous grant, the University agreed to keep the Arabian horses and continue the Sunday horse shows that began in 1927 and continued to draw thousands of people, including some of Hollywood's biggest stars.</p> <p>In 1927, Charles B. Voorhis purchased 150 acres of land near San Dimas to build a facility for deserving and underprivileged boys. "Uncle Charlie," as he was known by his students, viewed his facility as a place where students could study an abbreviated, but intense, agricultural program.</p> <p>In 1933, Julian McPhee, assumed the presidency at California State Polytechnic University at San Luis Obispo. Known for his tight fiscal policy, McPhee saved the University during the years of the Great Depression. After those bleak years, McPhee's vision of expanding Cal Poly Pomona to Southern California came closer to reality.</p> <h2><a name="Cal_Poly_Pomona_Expands"></a>Cal Poly Pomona Expands</h2> <p>Plagued with financial problems, Voorhis was forced to close his doors only ten years after he had opened his facility. The demise of the Voorhis facility gave McPhee the opportunity to expand Cal Poly Pomona. In August of 1938, Charles Voorhis donated his facility as a gift to the California State University System. In August of 1938, McPhee's request for the land was approved and the entire horticulture program was moved from San Luis Obispo to the new Southern California campus.</p> <p>Further expansion was halted by the onset of World War II. The southern Cal Poly campus was closed when the majority of its students were called to active duty and the former Kellogg ranch was transformed into an Army remount station. After the war, the ranch faced an uncertain future, but in 1949 the 813-acre W.K. Kellogg Arabian Horse Ranch was deeded to the state, a proposal to which The Kellogg Foundation agreed, provided the Sunday horse shows resumed.</p> <p>In 1949, the first Cal Poly Pomona Float was entered in the Tournament of Roses Parade and won the Award of Merit. The Rose Float tradition continues today and marks the partnership of the two Cal Poly campuses.</p> <p>In 1956, the first classes were held on the campus in the present-day science building. Six programs in agriculture, leading to four bachelor of science degrees, were offered. In the Class of 1957, 57 agricultural majors were the first graduates of Cal Poly Pomona. By 1959, the curricula of the college included six degree programs in the arts and sciences and four in engineering.</p> <h2><a name="Women_Join_Cal_Poly_Pomona"></a>Women Join Cal Poly Pomona</h2> <p>Many changes occurred in 1961 which affected Cal Poly Pomona profoundly. The Master Plan for Higher Education established the California State College System with its own Board of Trustees, and women enrolled at the University for the first time with 329 women joining the student body of 2,436 men. In that same year, the Legislature enacted Education Code Section 22606, which identified the primary function of the State Colleges as "...the provision of instruction for undergraduate students and graduate students, through the master's degree, in the liberal arts and sciences, in applied fields and in the professions, including the teaching profession."</p> <p>The Legislature recognized the special responsibility of this institution as a "polytechnic college" by adding Education Code Section 40051 which authorized the college to emphasize "...the applied fields of agriculture, engineering, business, home economics, and other occupational and professional fields."</p> <p>In 1966, the California State Polytechnic College, Kellogg-Voorhis, was established as a separate institution from the San Luis Obispo school. Both campuses were awarded full university status in 1972. On June 1, 1972, the campus name was officially changed to California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. In 1982, The California State University and Colleges became The California State University.</p> <p>Over the years, Cal Poly Pomona has grown from a small campus with six undergraduate programs enrolling 550 men in 1956 to a nationally and internationally recognized university with 96 undergraduate and graduate programs enrolling currently over 25,326 men and women. But the legend of Kellogg's Arabian horse ranch has not been lost. The agricultural tradition begun by Voorhis and McPhee continues today. Cal Poly Pomona continues to be a leader in engineering education, providing well-trained graduates to meet current needs. And with an eye to the future, Cal Poly Pomona continues to expand its programs and facilities.</p> <h2><a name="The_Campus"></a>The Campus</h2> <p>Out of all the California State University campuses, Cal Poly Pomona may be the most unique. It spans approximately 1,400 acres and has over 60 buildings. There are numerous classrooms, a student union, an Arabian horse center, and a multi-level library that houses over three million items including periodicals, bound volumes, and microforms. Cal Poly Pomona is considered a mid-sized campus in comparison to other schools in the Cal State system, but it often has the feel of a small, private campus. Most classroom buildings are within reasonable walking distance of one another and the campus sits in a small valley surrounded by hills, qualities that help create the sense of community one finds at this university. There are also many organizations on campus for students to become involved in and it is very easy to meet fellow students. This campus is not a large, daunting university with great halls and impersonal classrooms, but a mid-sized teaching university. The emphasis is on students and making sure they get the most out of their educational experience at this university.</p> <p>While Cal Poly Pomona has the reputation of being an agricultural and engineering school, it offers a variety of other areas of study. Business, the arts, and Hospitality Management are just a few of the many programs offered here. Of the 25,326 students on campus, 1,595&nbsp;are graduate and credential students. With a student body that comes from a variety of geographical locations and cultures, Cal Poly Pomona is a very ethnically diverse campus.</p> <p>One of the most desirable qualities of Cal Poly Pomona is its location. It is near most major freeways and close to major civic centers and business districts. This makes it easily accessible for commuters. For students looking for a diverse education with interactive teaching and the added bonus of a convenient location, Cal Poly Pomona is often the right choice. Interactive campus map available at: <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/map">https://www.cpp.edu/map</a></p> <h2><a name="Location"></a>Location</h2> <p>Located south of the San Bernardino Freeway (Interstate 10) on the eastern slope of Kellogg Hill, the campus is the second largest in acreage in the state university system. The buildings represent a careful blending of the tile-roofed Spanish ranch structures built by W. K. Kellogg and the modern laboratory and classroom buildings of concrete and red brick. Campus development has preserved the beauty of the ranch and its original plantings. The combination of agricultural and livestock areas with science, engineering, environmental design, and liberal arts facilities provides for the full range of instruction in the Cal Poly Pomona program. (See campus map in the back section of the catalog.)</p> <p>A multi-level interchange, which is a link for the San Bernardino, Corona, Orange, Foothill, Pomona and Riverside Freeways, is located near the northeast corner of the campus. Approximately 40 minutes from the downtown areas of Los Angeles and San Bernardino, the university is also within easy freeway access from communities in Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside counties.

Association in such community is purely voluntary, and students may withdraw from it at any time that they consider the obligations of membership disproportionate to the benefits.</p> <p>While enrolled, students are subject to university authority, which includes the prerogative of dismissing students whose conduct is inimical to the aims of an institution of higher education.</p> <p>Rules of student conduct are included in the California Code of Regulations, Title 5, beginning at Section 41301.</p> <p>A student who violates university policies or regulations is subject to disciplinary action which can result in a warning, probation, suspension, or expulsion. Procedures under which the university may take disciplinary action against a student are specified by the Chancellor of the California State University as described in Executive Order 1098. These procedures are on the Student Conduct and Integrity website and are on file in the Student Conduct and Integrity Office, Building 26, Room 133.</p> <p>Inappropriate conduct by students or by applicants for admission is subject to discipline as provided in Sections 41301 and 41302 of Title 5, California Code of Regulations. These sections are as follows:</p> <h3>Student Conduct</h3> <h5><em><strong>Title 5, California Code of Regulations </strong></em><strong><em>§&nbsp;</em></strong><em><strong>41301. Standards for Student Conduct</strong></em></h5> <h4>(a) Campus Community Values</h4> <p>The university is committed to maintaining a safe and healthy living and learning environment for students, faculty, and staff. Each member of the campus community should choose behaviors that contribute toward this end. Students are expected to be good citizens and to engage in responsible behaviors that reflect well upon their university, to be civil to one another and to others in the campus community, and contribute positively to student and university life.</p> <h4>(b) Grounds for Student Discipline</h4> <p>Student behavior that is not consistent with the Student Conduct Code is addressed through an educational process that is designed to promote safety and good citizenship and, when necessary, impose appropriate consequences. The following are the grounds upon which student discipline can be based:</p> 
                  <ol start="1"> 
                   <li>Dishonesty, including: 
                    <ol start="1" style="list-style-type:upper-alpha"> 
                     <li>Cheating, plagiarism, or other forms of academic dishonesty that are intended to gain unfair academic advantage.</li> 
                     <li>Furnishing false information to a University official, faculty member, or campus office</li> 
                     <li>Forgery, alteration, or misuse of a University document, key, or identification instrument.</li> 
                     <li>Misrepresenting one's self to be an authorized agent of the university or one of its auxiliaries.</li> 
                    </ol> </li> 
                   <li>Unauthorized entry into, presence in, use of, or misuse of university property.</li>

                   <li>Willful, material and substantial obstruction of the free flow of pedestrian or other traffic, on or leading to campus property or an off-campus university related activity.</li> 
                   <li>Disorderly, lewd, indecent, or obscene behavior at a university related activity, or directed toward a member of the university community.</li>

                   <li>Violation of the Student Conduct Procedures, including: 
                    <ol start="1" style="list-style-type:upper-alpha"> 
                     <li>Falsification, distortion, or misrepresentation of information related to a student discipline matter.</li> 
                     <li>Disruption or interference with the orderly progress of a student discipline proceeding.</li>

                    </ol> </li> 
                   <li>Encouraging, permitting, or assisting another to do any act that could subject him or her to discipline.</li> 
                  </ol> <h4>(c) Procedures for Enforcing This Code</h4> <p>The chancellor shall adopt procedures to ensure students are afforded appropriate notice and an opportunity to be heard before the university imposes any sanction for a violation of the Student Conduct Code.&nbsp; [Note: At the time of publication, such procedures are set forth in California State University Executive Order 1098 (Revised June 23, 2015), available at <a href="https://calstate.edu/eo/EO-1098-rev-6-23-15.html">https://calstate.edu/eo/EO-1098-rev-6-23-15.html</a><a href="http://calstate.edu/eo/EO-1098-rev-6-23-15.html.">.</a>]</p> <h4>d) Application of This Code</h4> <p>Sanctions for the conduct listed above can be imposed on applicants, enrolled students, students between academic terms, graduates awaiting degrees, and students who withdraw from school while a disciplinary matter is pending. Conduct that threatens the safety or security of the campus community, or substantially disrupts the functions or operation of the university is within the jurisdiction of this Article regardless of whether it occurs on or off campus. Nothing in this Code may conflict with Education Code Section 66301 that prohibits disciplinary action against students based on behavior protected by the First Amendment.</p> <h4>Title 5, California Code of Regulations, § 41302.&nbsp; Disposition of Fees: Campus Emergency; Interim Suspension.</h4> <p>The president of the campus may place on probation, suspend, or expel a student for one or more of the causes enumerated in Section 41301. No fees or tuition paid by or for such student for the semester or summer session in which they are suspended or expelled shall be refunded. If the student is readmitted before the close of the semester, or summer session in which they are suspended, no additional tuition or fees shall be required of the student on account of the suspension.</p> <p>During periods of campus emergency, as determined by the president of the individual campus, the president may, after consultation with the chancellor, place into immediate effect any emergency regulations, procedures, and other measures deemed necessary or appropriate to meet the emergency, safeguard persons and property, and maintain educational activities.</p> <p>The president may immediately impose an interim suspension in all cases in which there is reasonable cause to believe that such an immediate suspension is required in order to protect lives or property and to insure the maintenance of order. A student so placed on interim suspension shall be given prompt notice of charges and the opportunity for a hearing within 10 days of the imposition of interim suspension. During the period of interim suspension, the student shall not, without prior written permission of the president or designated representative, enter any campus of the California State University other than to attend the hearing. Violation of any condition of interim suspension shall be grounds for expulsion.</p> <p>Note: Authority cited: Sections 66300, 66600, 89030, 89031 and 89035, Education Code.

The university is the primary social institution committed to the search for knowledge and the preservation of intellectual freedom. This commitment distinguishes the university from other institutions. Cal Poly Pomona is a community of learners - both teacher-scholars and students - who strive to promote, foster, and sustain academic freedom in its broadest context, with each individual free to pursue truth, knowledge, and meaning according to their own best judgment.</p> <h2><a name="Standard_of_Conduct"></a>Standard of Conduct</h2> <p>All members of the university community are expected to practice self-discipline, fair and independent judgment, and responsibility for their treatment of others. The relationship among faculty, administrators, staff and students should be free of exploitation, harassment, or discriminatory treatment. Particularly, intimate relationships between supervisors and employees, faculty and students, or between any individuals of unequal status are strongly discouraged because of the inherent power imbalance.</p> <p>All members of the university community are expected to exercise reasonable judgment regarding the separation of their rights, obligations, and activities as private citizens from their responsibilities to the university. Specifically, when they speak or act as private persons, they should avoid creating the impression of speaking or acting for the university.</p> <p>These statements are intended to preserve academic freedom, maintain professional conduct, and prevent potential discrimination, harassment, and conflict of interest.</p> <h2><a name="Exclusion_of_Students_from_Classes"></a>Exclusion of Students from Classes</h2> 
                  <ol start="1"> 
                   <li>An instructor may at any time exclude from their course students who are disrupting the orderly conduct of the classroom or are a hazard to themselves or others.</li> 
                   <li>Upon excluding a student from a class, the instructor shall, within two academic days, inform the following individuals in writing of the reasons for exclusion from class and that the student has three academic days to file a protest with the instructor's dean:

If the student desires to make such a protest, the college dean and department chairman will interview both the faculty member and the student(s) involved and the dean will make a final decision within three university academic days as to whether or not the student is to be allowed to return to class.</li> 
                    </ol> </li> 
                   <li>If the faculty member wishes to prefer disciplinary charges against the student involved, the faculty member shall submit such charges in writing to the Office of Student Conduct and Integrity. However, it will still be necessary to go through the specified process.</li> 
                  </ol> <h2><a name="Academic_Integrity"></a>Academic Integrity</h2> <p>The University is committed to maintaining academic integrity throughout the university community. Academic dishonesty is a serious offense that can diminish the quality of scholarship, the academic environment, the academic reputation, and the quality of a Cal Poly Pomona degree. The following policy is intended to define clearly academic dishonesty at Cal Poly Pomona and to state the responsibility of students, faculty and administrators relating to this subject.</p> <p>All forms of academic dishonesty at Cal Poly Pomona are a violation of university policy and will be considered a serious offense. Academic dishonesty includes but is not limited to:</p> 
                  <ol start="1" style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"> 
                   <li>Plagiarism - Plagiarism, is falsification or fabrication, it is presenting words, ideas or work of others as one's own work. Plagiarism includes, but is not limited to: copying homework, copying lab reports, copying computer programs, using a work or portion of a work written or created by another but not crediting the source, using one's own work completed in a previous class for credit in another class without permission, paraphrasing another's work without giving credit, and borrowing or using ideas without giving credit.</li> 
                   <li>Cheating - Cheating includes, but is not limited to: unauthorized "crib sheets,", or notes during an exam, copying from another, looking at another student's exam, opening books when not authorized, obtaining advance copies of exams, and having an exam regraded after making changes. Additionally, cheating is prohibited on homework, academic assignments for credit, exams given during classes, final exams and standardized tests such as the Graduating Writing Test and Math Diagnostic Test.</li> 
                   <li>Use of Unauthorized Study Aids - This includes, but is not limited to: utilization of other's computer programs or solutions, copying a copyrighted computer program without permission, using old lab reports, having others perform one's share of lab work, and using any material prohibited by the instructor.</li>

                  </ol> <h4>Consequences for Academic Dishonesty</h4> <p>In accordance with Executive Order 1098, academic dishonesty cases that occur in the classroom shall be handled by faculty members. However, after action has been taken by the faculty member, the faculty member shall report the incident to Student Conduct and Integrity. The Student Conduct and Integrity website has reporting instructions. Faculty will need to include information that identifies the student who was found responsible, the general nature of the offense, the action taken by the faculty member, and a recommendation as to whether or not additional disciplinary action should be considered by the Student Conduct and Integrity Office. This process provides a central location for all academic dishonesty cases as an opportunity to hold students accountable for multiple academic dishonesty situations that may occur with several departments and as a way to monitor trends in academic dishonesty. The Student Conduct and Integrity Office will determine appropriate disciplinary action based on the totality of the circumstances.&nbsp;<strong>However, The Office of Student Conduct &amp; Integrity cannot overturn any academic actions by faculty.</strong></p> <p style="margin-left:0in">Academic outcomes related to academic dishonesty are the responsibility of faculty members. Faculty are encouraged to follow the academic expectations that are outlined in their syllabus. Some common academic actions taken for academic dishonesty may include, but are not limited to: "0" on the assignment, "F" for the course, Reduced grade, partial credit, or other sanctions faculty deem appropriate.</p> <p style="margin-left:0in">Disciplinary outcomes related to academic dishonesty are determined in accordance with the student conduct procedures described in Executive Order 1098. Outcomes may include, but are not limited to: warnings, probation, suspension, expulsion, or educational assignments intended to discourage the recurrence of academic dishonesty.</p> <p>The responsibility of all students is to be informed of what constitutes academic dishonesty and to follow the policy. A student who is aware of another student's academic dishonesty should report the instance to the instructor of the class, the test administrator, or the head of the department within which the course is offered. Cal Poly Pomona students who come from various international educational systems and wish to understand better the expectations of the American educational system are encouraged to speak with an international student advisor in the International Center.</p> <h2><a name="Campus_Violence"></a>Campus Violence</h2> <p>The University has a Zero Tolerance policy for threats or acts of violence against members of the campus community.</p> <p>Civility, understanding, and mutual respect are intrinsic to excellence in teaching, learning and maintaining a productive work environment. The university is also committed to providing a safe and healthy campus culture, which serves the needs of its many constituencies.</p> <p>The university prohibits and will take decisive action to eliminate:</p> 
                  <ul> 
                   <li>Verbal or written harassment</li> 
                   <li>Behaviors or actions interpreted by a reasonable person as carrying the potential for violence and/or acts of aggression such as:</li> 
                   <li>Acts which can be interpreted as physical assault</li> 
                   <li>Threats to harm someone or endanger the safety of others</li> 
                   <li>Threats to destroy or the actual destruction of property</li> 
                   <li>Possession of a weapon (Penal Code 626.9 prohibits bringing a firearm, knife or dangerous weapon onto the campus of a public school including the California State University).</li> 
                  </ul> <p>Such conduct is subject to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal from employment, expulsion from the university, or civil or criminal prosecution, as appropriate.</p> <p>To fulfill this policy, the university will work to prevent violence from occurring and will ensure that federal and state laws, as well as university regulations prohibiting violence, are enforced. In determining whether conduct constitutes a credible threat or act of violence, the circumstances surrounding the conduct will be considered.</p> <p>It is the responsibility of every administrator, faculty member, staff member, and student to take any threat of violence seriously. All threats must be reported to the appropriate authority. Failure to report any threat is subject to disciplinary action. Managers/supervisors can also be held responsible for civil and personal liability. When confronted by an imminent or actual incident of violence, call 9-1-1 immediately (if calling from a campus phone) or 909-869-3070 (if calling from a mobile phone on campus); calling 9-1-1 from a mobile phone will route calls to the California Highway Patrol (CHP) and not University Police. When presented with a threat of possible violence, action is recommended as follows:</p> 
                  <ul> 
                   <li>Threats by a student should be reported immediately to the University Police Department and the Director of Student Conduct and Integrity;</li> 
                   <li>Threats by a staff or student employee should be reported immediately to the University Police Department and the reporting employee's supervisor, who will contact the Associate Vice President for Human Resource Services for assistance;</li> 
                   <li>Threats by a faculty member should be reported immediately to the University Police Department and the appropriate Dean's Office for consultation with the Associate Vice President for Faculty Affairs;</li> 
                   <li>Threats from others not affiliated as a student or employee of the university should be reported immediately to the University Police Department.</li> 
                  </ul> <p>The Behavioral Intervention Team (BIT) has been created to address issues of campus violence. The purpose of the BIT is to proactively identify, assess, and offer a coordinated institutional response to community members (and non-members) who pose a risk to themselves, others and/or the campus community.

Any acts or threats of violence, property damage, harassment, intimidation or other crimes designed to infringe upon those rights will be given the utmost priority. The University and University Police are dedicated to maintaining a cooperative effort with local, state and federal agencies as well as the community we serve toward the immediate investigation of reported hate crimes and hate-related incidents, and prosecution and/or University sanctions as appropriate.</p> <p>This policy provides: (a) guidelines for identifying and investigating reportable crimes and incidents and (b) the resources to which victims can be referred for assistance.</p> <h3>Definitions of Hate-Motivated Crimes and Incidents</h3> <p>Hate Crime: Any unlawful action designed to frighten, harm, injure, intimidate or harass an individual, in whole or in part, because of a bias motivation against the actual or perceived race, religion, ethnic/national origin, sexual orientation, gender, or disability of the victim.</p> <p>Hate Incident: Not all expressions of hate or group bias rise to the level of a hate crime as defined in state and federal statute. A noncriminal act or incident, while not criminal, is done with the apparent intention to: harass, intimidate, threaten, retaliate, and create conflict, because of a person's race, ethnic/national origin, religious belief, sexual orientation, gender, or disability. Reporting and monitoring of hate incidents is important, as they may serve as indicators of potential threats and/or campus climate that may escalate into criminal acts.</p> <h3>Reporting and Referrals For Hate-Motivated Crimes and Incidents</h3> <p>The University Police Department is responsible for collecting and reporting hate-motivated statistics. Hate-motivated crimes and incidents may be reported to the following locations on campus:</p>

While romantic, sexual, intimate, personal or social relationships between members of the university community may begin as consensual, they may evolve into situations that lead to sexual harassment or sexual misconduct, including dating or domestic violence, or stalking, subject to this policy.</p> <p style="text-align:justify">Claiming that the conduct was not motivated by sexual desire is not a defense to a complaint of harassment based on gender.</p> 
                  <ul> 
                   <li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Sexual Misconduct</strong>:&nbsp; All sexual activity between members of the university community must be based on affirmative consent. Engaging in any sexual activity without first obtaining affirmative consent to the specific activity is sexual misconduct, whether or not the conduct violates any civil or criminal law. Sexual activity includes, but is not limited to, kissing, touching intimate body parts, fondling, intercourse, penetration of any body part, and oral sex. It also includes any unwelcome physical acts, such as unwelcome sexual touching, sexual assault, sexual battery, rape, and dating violence. When based on gender, domestic violence or stalking also constitute sexual misconduct. Sexual misconduct may include using physical force, violence, threat or intimidation, ignoring the objections of the other person, causing the other person's intoxication or incapacitation through the use of drugs or alcohol, or taking advantage of the other person's incapacitation (including voluntary intoxication) to engage in sexual activity.&nbsp; Men as well as women can be victims of these forms of sexual misconduct. Sexual activity with a minor is never consensual when the complainant is under 18 years old, because the minor is considered incapable of giving legal consent due to age.</li> 
                   <li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Sexual Assault</strong> is a form of sexual misconduct and is an attempt, coupled with the ability, to commit a violent injury on the person of another because of that person's gender or sex.</li> 
                   <li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Sexual Battery</strong> is a form of sexual misconduct and is any willful and unlawful use of force or violence upon the person of another because of that person's gender or sex as well as touching an intimate part of another person against that person's will and for the purpose of sexual arousal, gratification or abuse.</li> 
                   <li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Rape </strong>is a form of sexual misconduct and is non-consensual sexual intercourse that may also involve the use of threat of force, violence, or immediate and unlawful bodily injury or threats of future retaliation and duress. Any sexual penetration, however slight, is sufficient to constitute rape. Sexual acts including intercourse are considered non-consensual when a person is incapable of giving consent because they are incapacitated from alcohol and/or drugs, is under 18 years old, or if a mental disorder or developmental or physical disability renders the person incapable of giving consent. The respondent's relationship to the person (such as family member, spouse, friend, acquaintance or stranger) is irrelevant.</li> 
                   <li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Acquaintance Rape</strong> is a form of sexual misconduct committed by an individual known to the victim. This includes a person the victim may have just met; i.e., at a party, introduced through a friend, or on a social networking website.</li> 
                   <li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Affirmative Consent</strong> means an informed, affirmative, conscious, voluntary, and mutual agreement to engage in sexual activity.&nbsp; It is the responsibility of each person involved in the sexual activity to ensure that they have the affirmative consent of the other participant(s) to engage in the sexual activity.&nbsp; Lack of protest or resistance does not mean consent nor does silence mean consent.&nbsp; Affirmative consent must be voluntary, and given without coercion, force, threats or intimidation. 
                    <ul> 
                     <li>The existence of a dating or social relationship between those involved, or the fact of past sexual activities between them, should never by itself be assumed to be an indicator of affirmative consent.&nbsp; A request for someone to use a condom or birth control does not, in and of itself, constitute affirmative consent.</li> 
                     <li>Affirmative consent can be withdrawn or revoked.&nbsp;Consent to one form of sexual activity (or sexual act) does not constitute consent to other forms of sexual activity. Consent given to sexual activity on one occasion does not constitute consent on another occasion.&nbsp;There must always be mutual and affirmative consent to engage in sexual activity.&nbsp; Consent must be ongoing throughout a sexual activity and can be revoked at any time, including after penetration.&nbsp;Once consent is withdrawn or revoked, the sexual activity must stop immediately.</li> 
                     <li>A person who is incapacitated cannot give affirmative consent. A person is unable to consent when they are asleep, unconscious or is incapacitated due to the influence of drugs, alcohol, or medication so that they could not understand the fact, nature or extent of the sexual activity. A person is incapacitated if they lack the physical and/or mental ability to make informed, rational decisions.</li> 
                     <li>Whether an intoxicated person (as a result of using alcohol or other drugs) is incapacitated depends on the extent to which the alcohol or other drugs impact the person's decision-making capacity, awareness of consequences, and ability to make fully informed judgments. A person's own intoxication or incapacitation from drugs or alcohol does not diminish that person's responsibility to obtain affirmative consent before engaging in sexual activity.</li> 
                     <li>A person with a medical or mental disability may also lack the capacity to give consent.</li> 
                     <li>Sexual activity with a minor (a person under 18 years old) is not consensual, because a minor is considered incapable of giving legal consent due to age.</li> 
                     <li>It shall not be a valid excuse that a person affirmatively consented to the sexual activity if the respondent knew or reasonably should have known that the person was unable to consent to the sexual activity under any of the following circumstances: 
                      <ul> 
                       <li>The person was asleep or unconscious;</li> 
                       <li>The person was incapacitated due to the influence of drugs, alcohol or medication, so that the person could not understand the fact, nature or extent of the sexual activity;</li> 
                       <li>The person was unable to communicate due to a mental or physical condition</li> 
                      </ul> </li> 
                     <li>It shall not be a valid excuse that the respondent believed that the person consented to the sexual activity under either of the following circumstances: 
                      <ul> 
                       <li>The respondent's belief in affirmative consent arose from the intoxication or recklessness of the respondent;</li> 
                       <li>The respondent did not take reasonable steps, in the circumstances known to the respondent at the time, to ascertain whether the person affirmatively consented.</li> 
                      </ul> </li> 
                    </ul> </li> 
                   <li><strong>Consensual Relationships:</strong>&nbsp; Consensual relationship means a sexual or romantic relationship between two persons who voluntarily enter into such a relationship. While sexual and/or romantic relationships between members of the university community may begin as consensual, they may evolve into situations that lead to discrimination, harassment, retaliation, sexual misconduct, dating or domestic violence or stalking. 
                    <ul> 
                     <li>A university employee shall not enter into a consensual relationship with a student or employee over whom they exercise direct or otherwise significant academic, administrative, supervisory, evaluative, counseling, or extracurricular authority.&nbsp; In the event such a relationship already exists, each campus shall develop a procedure to reassign such authority to avoid violations of this policy.</li> 
                     <li>This prohibition does not limit the right of an employee to make a recommendation on the personnel matters concerning a family or household member where the right to make recommendations on such personnel matters is explicitly provided for in the applicable collective bargaining agreement or MPP/confidential personnel plan.</li> 
                    </ul> </li> 
                   <li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Domestic Violence </strong>is abuse committed against someone who is a current or former spouse, current or former cohabitant, someone with whom the respondent has a child, someone with whom the respondent has or had a dating or engagement relationship, or a person similarly situated under California domestic or family violence law. Cohabitant means two unrelated persons living together for a substantial period of time, resulting in some permanency of relationship. It does not include roommates who do not have a romantic, intimate, or sexual relationship. Factors that may determine whether persons are cohabiting include, but are not limited to (1) sexual relations between the parties while sharing the same living quarters, (2) sharing of income or expenses, (3) joint use or ownership of property, (4) whether the parties hold themselves out as spouses, (5) the continuity of the relationship, and (6) the length of the relationship. For purposes of this definition, "abuse" means intentionally or recklessly causing or attempting to cause bodily injury or placing another person in reasonable apprehension of imminent serious bodily injury to himself or herself, or another. Abuse does not include non-physical, emotional distress or injury.</li> 
                   <li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Dating Violence</strong> is abuse committed by a person who is or has been in a social or dating relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the victim. This may include someone the victim just met; i.e., at a party, introduced through a friend, or on a social networking website.&nbsp; For purposes of this definition, "abuse" means intentionally or recklessly causing or attempting to cause bodily injury or placing another person in reasonable apprehension of imminent serious bodily injury to himself or herself, or another.&nbsp; Abuse does not include non-physical, emotional distress or injury.&nbsp;</li> 
                   <li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Stalking&nbsp;</strong>means engaging in a repeated course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to fear for their or others' safety or to suffer substantial emotional distress.&nbsp; For purposes of this definition: 
                    <ul> 
                     <li>Course of conduct means two or more acts, including but not limited to, acts in which the stalker directly, indirectly, or through third parties, by any action, method, device, or means, follows, monitors, observes, surveils, threatens, or communicates to or about a person, or interferes with a person's property;</li> 
                     <li>Reasonable person means a reasonable person under similar circumstances and with the same protected status(es) as the complainant;</li> 
                     <li>Substantial emotional distress means significant mental suffering or anguish that may, but does not necessarily, require medical or other professional treatment or counseling.</li>

Except as provided below under confidentiality and sexual misconduct, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking, any university employee who knows or has reason to know of allegations or acts that violate university policy shall promptly inform the Title IX Coordinator. These employees are required to disclose all information including the names of the parties, <strong>even where the person has requested that their name remain confidential</strong>. The Title IX Coordinator will determine whether confidentiality is appropriate given the circumstances of each such incident. (See confidential reporting options outlined below.)</p> <p style="text-align:justify">Regardless of whether an alleged victim of gender discrimination ultimately files a complaint, if the campus knows or has reason to know about possible sexual discrimination, harassment or misconduct, it must review the matter to determine if an investigation is warranted.

The use of alcohol or drugs never makes the victim at fault for gender discrimination, harassment or sexual misconduct; therefore, victims should not be deterred from reporting incidents of sexual misconduct out of a concern that they might be disciplined for related violations of drug, alcohol or other university policies. Except in extreme circumstances, victims of sexual misconduct shall not be subject to discipline for related violations of the Student Conduct Code.</p> <p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Information Regarding Campus, Criminal and Civil Consequences of Committing Acts of Sexual Violence </strong></p> <p style="text-align:justify">Individuals alleged to have committed sexual misconduct may face criminal prosecution by law enforcement and may incur penalties as a result of civil litigation. In addition, students may face discipline at the university, up to and including suspension or explusion and withholding of their degrees. Employees may face sanctions up to and including dismissal from employment, pursuant to established CSU policies and provisions of applicable collective bargaining unit agreements.</p> <p style="text-align:justify">Students who are charged by the university with gender discrimination, harassment or violence will be subject to discipline, pursuant to the California State University Student Conduct Procedures (see <a href="https://calstate.policystat.com/policy/8453518/latest/">Executive Order 1098</a>, revised on August 14, 2020, or any successor executive order) and will be subject to appropriate sanctions. In addition, during any investigation, the university may implement interim measures in order to maintain a safe and non-discriminatory educational environment. Such measures may include: immediate interim suspension from the university; a required move from university-owned or affiliated housing; adjustments to course schedule; and/or prohibition from contact with parties involved in the alleged incident.</p> <p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Confidentiality and Sexual Misconduct, Dating Violence, Domestic Violence and Stalking </strong></p> <p>The university encourages victims of sexual misconduct, dating violence, domestic violence or stalking to talk to someone about what happened - so they can get the support they need, and so the university can respond appropriately.</p> <h4 style="text-align:justify">Privileged and Confidential Communications</h4> <p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Physicians, Psychotherapists, Professional Licensed Counselors, Licensed Clinical Social Workers, and Clergy</strong> - Physicians, psychotherapists, professional, licensed counselors, licensed clinical social workers, and clergy who work or volunteer on or off campus, acting solely in those roles or capacities as part of their employment, and who provide medical or mental health treatment or counseling (and those who act under their supervision, including all individuals who work or volunteer in their centers and offices) may not report any information about an incident of sexual misconduct to anyone else at the university, including the Title IX Coordinator, without the victim's consent. A victim can seek assistance and support from physicians, psychotherapists, professional, licensed counselors, licensed clinical social workers and clergy without triggering a university investigation that could reveal the victim's identity or the fact of the victim's disclosure. However, see limited exceptions below regarding when health care practitioners must report to local law enforcement agencies. Health care practitioners should explain these limited exceptions to victims, if applicable.</p> <p><strong>Sexual Assault and Domestic Violence Counselors and Advocates</strong> - Sexual assault and domestic violence counselors and advocates who work or volunteer on or off campus in sexual assault centers, victim advocacy offices, women's centers and health centers (including those who act in that role under their supervision, along with non-professional counselors or advocates who work or volunteer in sexual assault centers, victim advocacy offices, women's centers, gender equity centers, or health centers), may talk to a victim without revealing any information about the victim and the incident of sexual misconduct to anyone else at the university, including the Title IX Coordinator, without the victim's consent. A victim can seek assistance and support from these counselors and advocates without triggering a university investigation that could reveal their identity or that a victim disclosed an incident to them. However, see limited exceptions below regarding when sexual assault and domestic violence counselors and advocates must report to local law enforcement agencies. Counselors and advocates should explain these limited exceptions to victims, if applicable.</p> <p style="text-align:justify">The university will be unable to conduct an investigation into a particular incident or pursue disciplinary action against a perpetrator if a victim chooses to (1) speak only to a physician, professional licensed counselor, licensed clinical social worker, clergy member, sexual assault counselor, domestic violence counselor or advocate; and (2) maintain complete confidentiality. Even so, these individuals will assist victims in receiving other necessary protection and support, such as victim advocacy, disability services, medical/health or mental health services, or legal services, and will advise victims regarding their right to file a Title IX complaint with the university and a separate complaint with local or university police. If a victim insists on confidentiality, such professionals, counselors and advocates will likely not be able to assist the victim with: university academic support or accommodations; changes to university-based living or working schedules; or adjustments to course schedules. A victim who at first requests confidentiality may later decide to file a complaint with the university or report the incident to the police, and thus have the incident fully investigated. These counselors and advocates can provide victims with that assistance if requested by the victim. These counselors and advocates will also explain that Title IX includes protections against retaliation, and that the university will not only take steps to prevent retaliation when it knows or reasonably should know of possible retaliation, but will also take strong responsive action if it retaliation occurs.</p> <p><strong>EXCEPTIONS:</strong>&nbsp; Under California law, any health practitioner employed in a health facility, clinic, physician's office, or local or state public health department or clinic is required to make a report to local law enforcement if they provide medical services for a physical condition to a patient/victim who they know or reasonably suspects is suffering from (1) a wound or physical injury inflicted by a firearm; or (2) any wound or other physical injury inflicted upon a victim where the injury is the result of assaultive or abusive conduct (including sexual misconduct, domestic violence, and dating violence). This exception does not apply to sexual assault and domestic violence counselors and advocates. Health care practitioners should explain this limited exception to victims, if applicable.</p> <p>Additionally, under California law, all professionals described above (physicians, psychotherapists, professional counselors, licensed clinical social workers, clergy, and sexual assault and domestic violence counselors and advocates) are mandatory child abuse and neglect reporters, and are required to report incidents involving victims under 18 years of age to local law enforcement. These professionals will explain this limited exception to victims, if applicable.</p> <p style="text-align:justify">Finally, some or all of these professionals may also have reporting obligations under California law to: (1) local law enforcement in cases involving threats of immediate or imminent harm to self or others where disclosure of the information is necessary to prevent the threatened danger; or (2) to the court if compelled by court order or subpoena in a criminal proceeding related to the sexual misconduct, dating or domestic violence, or stalking incident. If applicable, these professionals will explain this limited exception to victims.</p> <h4 style="text-align:justify">Reporting to University or Local Police</h4> <p style="text-align:justify">If a victim reports to local or university police about sexual misconduct crimes, the police are required to notify victims that their names will become a matter of public record unless confidentiality is requested. If a victim requests that their identity be kept confidential, their name will not become a matter of public record and the police will not report the victim's identity to anyone else at the university, including the Title IX Coordinator. University police will, however, report the facts of the incident itself to the Title IX Coordinator being sure not to reveal to the Title IX Coordinator victim names/identities or compromise their own criminal investigation. The university is required by the federal Clery Act to report certain types of crimes (including certain sex offenses) in statistical reports. However, while the university will report the type of incident in the annual crime statistics report known as the Annual Security Report, victim names/identities will not be revealed.</p> <h4 style="text-align:justify">Reporting to the Title IX Coordinator and Other University Employees</h4> <p>Most university employees have a duty to report incidents of sexual misconduct when they are on notice of it. When a victim tells the Title IX Coordinator or another university employee about an incident of sexual misconduct, the victim has the right to expect the university to take immediate and appropriate steps to investigate what happened and to resolve the matter promptly and equitably. In all cases, the university strongly encourages victims to report incidents directly to the campus Title IX Coordinator. As detailed above, in the "Privileged and Confidential Communications" section of this policy, all university employees except physicians, licensed professional counselors, licensed clinical social workers, sexual assault counselors and advocates, must report to the Title IX Coordinator all relevant details about any incidents of sexual misconduct of which they become aware. The university will need to determine what happened - and will need to know the names of the victim(s) and the perpetrator(s), any witnesses, and any other relevant facts, including the date, time and specific location of the incident.</p> <p>To the extent possible, information reported to the Title IX Coordinator or other university employees will be shared only with individuals responsible for handling the university's response to the incident. The university will protect the privacy of individuals involved in a sexual misconduct violence incident except as otherwise required by law or university policy. A report of sexual misconduct may result in the gathering of extremely sensitive information about individuals in the campus community. While such information is considered confidential, university policy regarding access to public records and disclosure of personal information may require disclosure of certain information concerning a report of sexual misconduct. In such cases, efforts will be made to redact the records, as appropriate, in order to protect the victim's identity and privacy and the privacy of other involved individuals. Except as detailed in the section on "Privileged and Confidential Communications" above, no university employee, including the Title IX Coordinator, should disclose the victim's identity to the police without the victim's consent or unless the victim has also reported the incident to the police.</p> <p style="text-align:justify">If a victim requests of the Title IX Coordinator or another university employee that their identity remain completely confidential, the Title IX Coordinator will explain that the university cannot always honor that request or guarantee complete confidentiality. If a victim wishes to remain confidential or request that no investigation be conducted or disciplinary action taken, the university must weigh that request against the university's obligation to provide a safe, non-discriminatory environment for all students, employees, and third parties, including the victim. Under those circumstances, the Title IX Coordinator will determine whether the victim's request for complete confidentiality and/or no investigation can be honored under the facts and circumstances of the particular case, including whether the university has a legal obligation to report the incident, conduct an investigation or take other appropriate steps. Without information about a victim's identity, the university's ability to meaningfully investigate the incident and pursue disciplinary action against the perpetrator may be severely limited.

Sexual assault includes rape, acquaintance rape, and sexual battery. The University will promptly investigate all allegations of sexual assault and take appropriate action where required. The following information summarizes the University's Sexual Assault Policy Statement.</p> <h4>University Procedures Regarding Sexual Assault</h4> <p>Rape and sexual assault are criminal violations of California sexual assault laws and violations of the university code of conduct. Anyone charged with a sexual assault violation which is campus-related may be subject to: (a) a criminal charge filed against the individual, and/or (b) an administrative proceeding initiated by the University. Proceedings may occur concurrently. Disciplinary actions may include probation, suspension, expulsion, or termination from the University even if there is no criminal prosecution. Additional sanctions may be imposed, depending upon the nature of the offense and surrounding circumstances.</p> <p>Established Cal Poly Pomona student disciplinary, grievance or other complaint procedures, including those procedures found in CSU Executive Orders including 1095, 1097 and 1098, or the current Statement of Student Rights, Responsibilities and Grievance Procedures, will be utilized as appropriate in resolving these matters.</p> <p>The University will respect the confidentiality of the survivor and will disclose information under the following circumstances: a) with the permission of the survivor, or b) when it is necessary for the safety or in the best interest of the campus community.</p> <h4>Definitions of Sexual Assault in the California Penal Code</h4> 
                  <ol start="1"> 
                   <li>Rape is defined in Section 261 of the California Penal Code as non-consensual sexual intercourse. It may involve the use or threat of force, violence, retaliation, or immediate bodily injury. Rape also occurs when the victim is incapable of giving legal consent, for example, when: a) the victim has a mental disorder, or is developmentally or physically disabled; or b) the victim is prevented from resisting the assault due to intoxicating substances (e.g. alcohol or drugs); or c) the victim is unconscious of the nature of the act and is known to the accused. Consent is defined as positive cooperation in an act or attitude pursuant to an exercise of free will; the person must act freely and voluntarily and have knowledge of the nature of the act or transaction involved.</li> 
                   <li>Acquaintance Rape follows the same definition but is committed by someone the victim knows.</li> 
                   <li>Sexual Battery is defined in Section 243.4 of the California Penal Code as the touching of an intimate part of another person, if the touching is against the will of the person touched, for the purpose of sexual arousal, sexual gratification, or sexual assault. Assault with intent to commit a sexual battery is defined as an unlawful attempt, coupled with the present ability, to commit a violent injury (e.g. rape) on the person of another.</li> 
                  </ol> <h4>Safety of the Campus Community is Primary</h4> <p style="text-align:justify">The university's primary concern is the safety of its campus community members. The use of alcohol or drugs never makes the victim at fault for sexual discrimination, harassment or violence; therefore, victims should not be deterred from reporting incidents of sexual violence out of a concern that they might be disciplined for related violations of drug, alcohol or other university policies. Victims of sexual violence shall not be subject to discipline for related violations of the Student Conduct Code.</p> <h4>Information Regarding Campus, Criminal and Civil Consequences of Committing Acts of Sexual Violence</h4> <p style="text-align:justify">Individuals alleged to have committed sexual assault may face criminal prosecution by law enforcement and may incur penalties as a result of civil litigation. In addition, employees and students may face discipline at the university. Employees may face sanctions up to and including dismissal from employment, pursuant to established CSU policies and provisions of applicable collective bargaining unit agreements.</p> <p style="text-align:justify">Students who are charged by the university with sexual discrimination, harassment or violence will be subject to discipline, pursuant to the California State University Student Conduct Procedures (see Executive Order 1098 at&nbsp;<a href="https://calstate.policystat.com/policy/6742449/latest/">https://calstate.policystat.com/policy/6742449/latest/</a> or any successor executive order) and will be subject to appropriate sanctions. In addition, during any investigation, the university may implement interim measures in order to maintain a safe and non-discriminatory educational environment. Such measures may include: immediate interim suspension from the university; a required move from university-owned or affiliated housing; adjustments to course schedule; and/or prohibition from contact with parties involved in the alleged incident.</p> <h4>Additional Resources</h4> <p>Cal Poly Pomona sexual misconduct violence prevention and education statement, which includes facts and myths about sexual misconduct violence, EO 1095 (<a href="https://calstate.policystat.com/policy/6741651/latest/">https://calstate.policystat.com/policy/6741651/latest/</a>) and EO 1097 (<a href="https://calstate.policystat.com/policy/6742744/latest/">https://calstate.policystat.com/policy/6742744/latest/</a>).</p> <p><strong>U.S. Department of Education, regional office</strong>:<br> Office for Civil Rights<br> 50 United Nations Plaza<br> San Francisco, CA 94102<br> (415) 486-5555<br> TDD (877) 521-2172</p> <p><strong>U.S. Department of Education, national office</strong>:<br> Office for Civil Rights<br> (800) 872-5327</p> <p><strong>California Coalition Against Sexual Assault</strong><br> 1215 K.
